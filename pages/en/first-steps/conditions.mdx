# Conditions

You are constantly using conditions statements in your everyday lives. Is the water boiling in the pot? If it does, put in the pasta. Otherwise, wait a few more minutes. 🧑‍🍳

It's the same thing in your code. Depending on data, you can ask your program or algorithm to do act differently.

Let's set things up for this lesson.

Make a new folder somewhere on your computer, open it with VS Code, and create two files:

- `main.ts`, where we will write our code. To start, you can add `console.log("Hello!");` to it.
- `deno.json`, which lets VS Code know this is a Deno project and enables the Deno extension. You can tweak settings in this file, but we'll keep it empty for now.

Open the terminal and run the following command: `deno run --watch --check main.ts`

This command clears the terminal and reruns `main.ts` every time you save it (`CMD` + `S` on Mac or `CTRL` + `S` on PC).

You can use this setup to test the code provided in this lesson.

## Conditional statements

To write conditions, we use the conditional statements `if`, `else if` and `else`.

The first condition should always be tested with `if`. The condition should be between `()`. If the condition is met, the computer will execute what is found between the following `{}`.

If we want to test more than one condition, we use `else if` with a condition between `()` and following by code to be executed between `{}`. But you don't always need to test multiple conditions.

If we want run some code if none of the conditions were met, we use `else`. Because `else` doesn't test any condition, we don't need `()` but we must provide the code be executed between `{}`. Nothing forces you to finish with an `else`, but it often helps to avoid unexpected bugs.

For example, the code below compares `myAge` and `yourAge`:
- If `myAge` is greater than `yourAge` (line 6), we log `I am older than you!` in the terminal. The rest of the conditions statements are skipped and ignored.
- If the first condition is not met, we check another condition with `else if` (line 8). If `myAge` is smaller than `your age`, we log `You are older than me!`. The rest of the conditions statements are skipped and ignored.
- Finally, if none of the conditions above are met, it means that we are the same age. In this case, we use `else` (line 11) to log `We are the same age!`.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
// Change the ages
// to test the different outcomes.
const myAge = 36;
const yourAge = 25;

if (myAge > yourAge) {
  console.log("I am older than you!");
} else if (myAge < yourAge) {
  console.log("You are older than me!");
} else {
  console.log("We are the same age!");
}
```

## Comparison operators

The previous example works because we used the comparison operators `>` and `<` and they return a `boolean`.

Here are the main comparison operators you'll use in your daily work:
- `>`: greater than
- `>=`: greater than or equal to
- `<`: less than
- `<=`: less than or equal to
- `===`: equal to
- `!==`: not equal to

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
    You might see examples around the web with `==` and `!=`. These operators don't check for the type values, so it's best to stick with `===` and `!==` which check for strict equality.
</Callout>

And here are the operators in action.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
// Change the ages to test the different operators.
// Don't worry about the `: number` for now.
const myAge: number = 36;
const yourAge: number = 25;

const greater = myAge > yourAge;
console.log("greater =>", greater);

const greaterOrEqual = myAge >= yourAge;
console.log("greaterOrEqual =>", greaterOrEqual);

const younger = myAge < yourAge;
console.log("younger =>", younger);

const youngerOrEqual = myAge <= yourAge;
console.log("youngerOrEqual =>", youngerOrEqual);

const sameAge = myAge === yourAge;
console.log("sameAge =>", sameAge);

const differentAge = myAge !== yourAge;
console.log("differentAge =>", differentAge);
```

## Logical operators

Sometimes, you want to check multiple things in one conditional statement. This is where logical operators `&&` and `||` are handy.

For example, let's say we need an algorithm to check if you are old enough to have a dring in a bar in Quebec (at least 18) or Ontario (at least 19).

Without logicial operators, it could look like this, with nested conditions. It works, but nested conditions can easily be difficult to read and debug.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
// Change the age and province to test the conditions.
// Don't worry about the `: number` and `: string` for now.
const myAge: number = 18;
const myProvince: string = "Quebec";

if (myProvince === "Quebec") {
  if (myAge >= 18) {
    console.log("You are allowed!");
  } else {
    console.log("You are not allowed!");
  }
} else if (myProvince === "Ontario") {
  if (myAge >= 19) {
    console.log("You are allowed!");
  } else {
    console.log("You are not allowed!");
  }
} else {
  console.log("I don't know this province!");
}
```

Here's the same code with logical operators that allow us to check the `age` and `province` at the same time. Simpler to understand and easier to debug!

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
// Change the age and province to test the conditions.
// Don't worry about the `: number` and `: string` for now.
const myAge: number = 18;
const myProvince: string = "Quebec";

if (myProvince === "Quebec" && myAge >= 18) {
  console.log("You are allowed!");
} else if (myProvince === "Ontario" && myAge >= 19) {
  console.log("You are allowed!");
} else if (myProvince !== "Quebec" && myProvince !== "Ontario") {
  console.log("I don't know this province!");
} else {
  console.log("You are not allowed!");
}
```
