# Functions

By encapsulating code within functions, you can reuse the same code over and over. Functions also help break up long scripts into modular chunks, making them easier to manage and debug.

Let's set things up for this lesson.

Make a new folder somewhere on your computer, open it with VS Code, and create two files:

- `main.ts`, where we will write our code. To start, you can add `console.log("Hello!");` to it.
- `deno.json`, which lets VS Code know this is a Deno project and enables the Deno extension. You can tweak settings in this file, but we'll keep it empty for now.

Open the terminal and run the following command:  `deno run --watch --check main.ts`

This command clears the terminal and reruns `main.ts` every time you save it (`CMD` + `S` on Mac or `CTRL` + `S` on PC).

You can use this setup to test the code provided in this lesson.

## Basic function

To create a function, you need to declare it using the `function` keyword, followed by its name with parentheses `()` and curly brackets `{}`.

Let's create a function named `sayHello` that logs `"Hello!"`. The code you want the function to execute must go between the `{}`. (We'll talk about what goes between the `()` in a minute.)

Copy and paste the code below into `main.ts`.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

If you save and run this code, nothing will get logged. You created a function, but you haven't **called** it yet.

To **call a function**, you need to use its name followed by `()`, as shown on line 5 below.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

sayHello()
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
    Giving functions clear and understandable names is key to maintaining a clean, easy-to-debug, and reusable codebase. Since functions are supposed to do something, it's often a good idea to use a verb as a naming convention.
</Callout>

Now, you can reuse it as many times as you want!

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

sayHello()
sayHello()
sayHello()
sayHello()
sayHello()
```

![A screenshot showing VS Code logging multiple Hello!.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/hellos.png)

## Parameters

Our function is pretty basic. It would be more interesting if we could **pass** a `name` to it for a personalized greeting, like `"Hello, Nael!"`

To achieve this, we need to add a **parameter** to our function‚Äîsomething it can use.

Parameters are defined between the `()` when declaring the function, and they are typed.

In the code below, we add a parameter `name` to the function `sayHello` and specify that `name` must be of type `string`.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
function sayHello(name: string) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

sayHello();
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
    On line 1, the `name: string` syntax is called an **explicit type**. It means that `name` must be a `string`. Most of the time, the types in your code are inferred. But in some cases, you need to explicitly specify what you want the types to be. Defining function parameters is one of these cases.
</Callout>

If you copy, paste and save this code, you'll encounter an error. This happens because your function now expects a parameter `name`, and you're not providing it when calling the function on line 5.

![A screenshot showing VS Code showing an error because of a missing argument.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/missing-name.png)

Let's pass the **argument** `"Nael"` to the function on line 5. Now, it logs `"Hello, Nael!"`.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
function sayHello(name: string) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

sayHello("Nael");
```

![A screenshot showing VS Code logging "Hello Nael".](/assets/pushing-further/functions/hello-nael.png)

And now, we can call the same function with different names.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
function sayHello(name: string) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

sayHello("Nael");
sayHello("Emily");
sayHello("Diana");
sayHello("John");
sayHello("Jane");
```

![A screenshot showing VS Code logging multiple "Hello" with different names.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/hello-names.png)

Remember that function parameters are typed. If you try to pass a number instead of a string as `name`, you'll get an error.

Again, types work for you. Type checking on function parameters will save you from many debugging sessions. üêû

![A screenshot showing VS Code showing a type error.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/type-error.png)

Anything can be a function parameter: strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other functions!

You can also have multiple parameters between the function `()`, separated by a comma.

For example, here, we add a new parameter `isTired`, which is expected to be a boolean. When `isTired` is `true`, we add `"You look tired..."`. If it's `false`, we add `"You look great!"`.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
function sayHello(name: string, isTired: boolean) {
  if (isTired) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}! You look tired...`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}! You look great!`);
  }
}

sayHello("Nael", true);
sayHello("Emily", false);
```
![A screenshot showing VS Code showing a function with multiple parameters.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/multiple-parameters.png)

## Return

If you hover over the function (or start typing it), you'll see the **function signature**, which indicates the types of its parameters and what it returns.

It shows `function sayHello(name: string, isTired: boolean): void`. The `: void` at the end indicates that the function does not return anything, which makes sense because we are just logging information to the terminal for now.

![A screenshot showing VS Code showing a function signature.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/function-signature.png)

However, in many cases, you want a function to return something.

For example, let's say you're Canadian and want to visit the Eiffel Tower. You could create a function to convert Canadian dollars to Euros. As of the time of writing this (2025-01-22), the conversion rate is 0.67.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
function convertDollarsToEuros(dollars: number) {
  return dollars * 0.67;
}

convertDollarsToEuros(100);
```

Here, the function uses the keyword `return`. If you hover over the function, you'll see `: number` at the end, which means this function returns a number.

![A screenshot showing VS Code showing a function returning a number.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/return-number.png)

But if you run the code, it looks like nothing happens!

Actually, the calculations are performed and returned‚Äîbut returned to nowhere! You need to store the result somewhere or log it directly.

Let's create a variable `euros` to store the returned value of `convertDollarsToEuros(dollars)` and log a proper message.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
function convertDollarsToEuros(dollars: number) {
  return dollars * 0.67;
}

const dollars = 100;
const euros = convertDollarsToEuros(dollars);

console.log(`${dollars} Canadian dollars is ${euros} euros`);
```

![A screenshot showing VS Code logging how much dollars are in euros.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/proper-message.png)

As with parameters, returned values can be anything: strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even functions.

Because functions are typed, the variables storing their return values are automatically typed as well.

If you hover over `euros`, you'll see that its type is `number` because the return value of `convertDollarsToEuros` is `number`. When working on more complex algorithms with many functions, this type inference feels magical and helps you stay sane.

![A screenshot showing VS Code showing the type of a variable.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/euros-type.png)

## Exporting and importing

Since `main.ts` is our primary code entry point, we try to keep it lean. Cluttering it with function declarations is not optimal.

Typically, we keep functions in their own files. This makes debugging easier and also makes the functions reusable, as you can `import` them into other files.

We often group such functions into a folder called `helpers`.

In your current repository:
  1) Create a new folder named `helpers`.
  2) Create a new file named `convertDollarsToEuros.ts` in `helpers`.
  3) Cut and paste the `convertDollarsToEuros` function declaration into it.

Nothing will work for now, but that's okay. You can click on the image below to enlarge it, if needed.

![A screenshot showing VS Code showing two TypeScript files.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/new-file.png)

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
    In VS Code, files are opened as tabs. By default, only one tab is shown. If you want to see multiple tabs side by side, right-click on a tab and then click `Split up`, `Split down`, `Split left`, or `Split right`. In the screenshot above, I chose `Split right`.
</Callout>

Now, the `convertDollarsToEuros` function is in a separate file, but it can't be used anywhere else yet. There's a yellow warning about it.

We need to make it available by **exporting it**.

Update your code in `convertDollarsToEuros.ts` by adding the keywords `export default` on line 1.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="convertDollarsToEuros.ts" /export default/
export default function convertDollarsToEuros(dollars: number) {
  return dollars * 0.67;
}
```

Now that `convertDollarsToEuros` is exported, we can import it anywhere we want!

In our case, we want to use it in `main.ts`. To do this, add the following line at the beginning of the file: `import convertDollarsToEuros from "./helpers/convertDollarsToEuros.ts";`.

IntelliSense recognizes that the function is available. If you start typing, it will suggest it to you. Pretty neat! Press `Enter` to accept the suggestion.

If you're on a PC with Windows, you might see `\` instead of `/` in the file path.

![A screenshot showing VS Code import suggestion.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/intellisense.png)

Here's the code you should have in `main.ts`.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
import convertDollarsToEuros from "./helpers/convertDollarsToEuros.ts";

const dollars = 100;
const euros = convertDollarsToEuros(dollars);

console.log(`${dollars} Canadian dollars is ${euros} euros`);
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
    When you import a file, you need to tell your computer where to find it with a **path**. Here, `./helpers/convertDollarsToEuros.ts` is a **relative path** because it starts with `./`. The `.` tells the computer to start where the current file is. In this case, since we are updating `main.ts`, it starts in the folder where `main.ts` is. Then `/helpers` tells the computer to go inside the `helpers` folder. Finally, `/convertDollarsToEuros.ts` tells it to import the content of this file. On PC with Windows, the path might use `\` instead of `/`.
</Callout>

And now, everything works! If we had multiple files where `convertDollarsToEuros` was needed, we could easily import the function and reuse it in multiple places!

![A screenshot showing VS Code importing and using a TypeScript function.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/working.png)

Also, since we are watching `main.ts` by running `deno run --watch --check`, we are automatically watching all of `main.ts` dependencies. This means that if you update `convertDollarsToEuros.ts` and save it, the terminal will be cleared, and the script will be rerun too. So useful!

Change `0.67` to `0.65` to see it in action. Notice on the first line in the terminal which file change the `Watcher` detected.

![A screenshot showing Deno detecting a file change.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/file-change.png)
<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
    You might think that creating multiple files makes it more difficult to navigate your code. But if you press `CMD` on Mac or `CTRL` on PC and click on a function in your code, VS Code will automatically take you to the function‚Äôs file by opening a new tab.
</Callout>

## Documentation

Documenting your functions is crucial if you want to reuse them in the future. Comments can do a pretty good job, but there is something even more handy: **JSDoc**.

To create documentation with JSDoc syntax, you need to use `/**` at the beginning of the documentation and `*/` at the end. Each line should start with a `*`. And that's it!

Here's a basic documentation added at the beginning of `convertDollarsToEuros.ts`. We have a simple description at first, followed by a description of the parameter `dollars`, and finally a description of the returned value.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="convertDollarsToEuros.ts" {1-6}
/**
 * Converts an amount in Canadian dollars to euros.
 *
 * @param dollars - The amount in dollars to be converted.
 * @returns The equivalent amount in euros.
 */
export default function convertDollarsToEuros(dollars: number) {
  return dollars * 0.65;
}
```

The reason why JSDoc is so handy is because VS Code (and many other tools) understands it. If you hover over the function in `main.ts` now, you'll see not only the types but also your documentation popping up!

![A screenshot showing VS Code displaying JSDoc for a function.](/assets/pushing-further/functions/documentation.png)

We can improve our documentation by adding an example.

To ensure that VS Code recognize the example as code, we use a **fenced code block** with three backticks `` ``` ``. When opening the block, we also specify `ts` so VS Code knows it's TypeScript code and applies the relevant syntax highlighting.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="convertDollarsToEuros.ts" {4-9}
/**
 * Converts an amount in Canadian dollars to euros.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const dollars = 100;
 * const euros = convertDollarsToEuros(dollars);
 * console.log(euros); // 65
 * ```
 *
 * @param dollars - The amount in dollars to be converted.
 * @returns The equivalent amount in euros.
 */
export default function convertDollarsToEuros(dollars: number): number {
  return dollars * 0.65;
}
```

## Arrow functions

Sometimes, you just need a simple function, especially when passing functions as parameters in methods like those for arrays.

Arrow functions provide a shorter way to write functions.

For example, this is a regular function that logs a string.

```ts showLineNumbers
function sayHello(name: string) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

sayHello("Nael") // "Hello, Nael!"
```

It could be rewritten as an arrow function like this. It's called an arrow function because the `=>` resembles an arrow.

```ts showLineNumbers
const sayHello = (name: string) => console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);

sayHello("Nael") // "Hello, Nael!"
```

In the example above, there is no significant benefit to using an arrow function. However, when working with array methods, arrow functions can make your code simpler and more readable.

In the code below, we have an array of numbers that we want to filter, keeping only the positive numbers. The `.filter()` method requires a function as a parameter, so we declare the `isPositive` function and pass it to `.filter()`.

Here's how it looks with a regular function.

```ts showLineNumbers
const numbers = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2];

function isPositive(num: number) {
  return num > 0;
}

const positiveNumbers = numbers.filter(isPositive);

console.log(positiveNumbers); // [1, 2]
```

But we could simplify all of this by using an arrow function directly inside the `.filter()` parentheses.

```ts showLineNumbers /(num) => num > 0/
const numbers = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2];

const positiveNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num > 0);

console.log(positiveNumbers); // [1, 2]
```

Because the type of `numbers` is inferred as a `number[]`, your computer infers that the arrow function parameter `num` can only be a `number`. It's very convenient.

With the regular function, you had to explicitly type `num: number` because your computer had no way of knowing for sure what `num` was supposed to be.

## Conclusion

Functions are a fundamental part of programming. They help you organize your code, make it reusable, and keep it clean.
