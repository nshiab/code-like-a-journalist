# How to use CSS to style a web page

CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheets*. It defines how elements on a web page should be displayed. Its syntax is simple and straightforward. CSS is not a programming language. There are no conditions, loops, or functions. Instead, it consists of structured text that instructs the browser on how to present elements to the user.

Before starting, make sure you have completed the previous sections, especially **1. First steps üßë‚Äçüéì**, **2. Pushing further üöÄ**, and the lesson on [HTML](/web-basics/html).

## Setup

You don't need to install anything for this lesson. Simply open an empty folder in VS Code, create an `index.html` file, and copy and paste the code from the previous lesson into it.

```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Alma Mater</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
    <p>I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM).</p>
    <img src="university.jpg" alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."/>

</body>
</html>
```

## Inline style

You can style specific HTML elements directly using the `style` attribute. The CSS syntax consists of *properties* assigned to *values*.

For example, we can set the `color` of the first paragraph to `blue` and the second one to `red`. We can also change the `font-weight` to `bold`.

Note that there are many different ways to define colors in code. Here, we are using color *names*. There are around [140 recognized color names](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php) that browsers understand. If you want to learn more about colors, check [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/default.asp).

In the `style` attribute, each property-value pair must be separated by a `;`.

```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html" /style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"/ /style="color:red; font-weight: bold;"/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Alma Mater</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
    <p style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM).</p>
    <img src="university.jpg" alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."/>

VS Code recognizes some basic CSS properties and values, like colors. Here, it added a small square displaying the selected color. However, this is not part of the code. It‚Äôs just a visual guide provided by the code editor.

## Using the `style` element

### Selecting elements

Inline CSS can be useful for quick, simple projects, but it becomes difficult to maintain in long-term or complex projects. If you want to keep your CSS within the HTML file, it's best to group everything inside a `style` tag.

With inline CSS, the browser knows exactly which element is being styled. However, when using the `style` element, we need to use *selectors* to specify which elements should be styled and how.

The syntax follows this structure: the selector comes first, followed by property-value pairs enclosed in curly brackets. The pairs must be separated by a `;`. For example, the code below instructs the browser to apply bold formatting to all `p` elements on the page.

```css showLineNumbers
p {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
 The indentation above is just to make the CSS more readable for us, humans. Browsers don‚Äôt need it and rely only on the code structure. Many developers use tools to *minify* their CSS by removing spaces and line breaks, creating smaller files that load faster and use less bandwidth. We‚Äôll cover this topic in another lesson.

### `id` selectors

Let's update our previous code to use the `style` element. Since this is just to tell the browser how to display elements, we keep it in the `head`.

```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html" {7-19} /id="first-paragraph"/ /id="second-paragraph"/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Alma Mater</title>
    <style>
        p {
            font-weight: bold;
        }

        #first-paragraph {
            color: blue;
        }

        #second-paragraph {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
    <p id="first-paragraph">I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM).</p>
    <img src="university.jpg" alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."/>
    <p id="second-paragraph">The picture above comes from Wikimedia. You can find it <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UQAM-Judith-Jasmin.jpg">here</a> along with its license.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
![A screenshot showing CSS within a `style` element.](/assets/web-basics/css/style.png)

Have you noticed the `#first-paragraph` (line 12) and `#second-paragraph` (line 16) selectors? And the `id` attributes in the HTML (lines 23 and 25)?

Since we want all `p` elements to be bold, we use the `p` selector for `font-weight: bold`. However, we also want the first paragraph to be blue and the second paragraph to be red, so we use `id`s.

In the HTML, we assign the `id` attributes `first-paragraph` and `second-paragraph`. This allows us to target these specific paragraphs in CSS using the `#first-paragraph` and `#second-paragraph` selectors (notice the `#` symbol).

Keep in mind that an `id` should be unique. Each one should appear only once on a page.

### `class` selectors

Element selectors (like `p`) target all matching elements on the page. For example, all `p` elements can be styled as bold.

In contrast, `id`s are useful for targeting a single, specific element.

But what if you want to style multiple elements without affecting all of them? The answer is `class` selectors.

For example, let‚Äôs add a third paragraph and say we want the last two paragraphs to be red.

```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html" {16-18, 26} /class="red-text"/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Alma Mater</title>
    <style>
        p {
            font-weight: bold;
        }

        #first-paragraph {
            color: blue;
        }

        .red-text {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
    <p id="first-paragraph">I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM).</p>
    <img src="university.jpg" alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."/>
    <p class="red-text">The picture above comes from Wikimedia. You can find it <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UQAM-Judith-Jasmin.jpg">here</a> along with its license.</p>
    <p class="red-text">Montreal is a wonderful city. You should visit it!</p>
</body>
</html>
```
![A screenshot showing CSS with classes.](/assets/web-basics/css/classes.png)

In the code above, we replaced the `id` attribute and the `second-paragraph` property with a `class` attribute assigned the value `red-text`.

Now, we can use the class selector `.red-text` (note the `.`) to modify the style of all elements that have this `class` (in this case, the last two paragraphs).

You can assign a class to as many elements as needed.

### More about selectors

If you want to override a property's value, you must understand the hierarchy of selectors:

- Inline styles override any styles defined by other selectors.
- `id` selectors override styles defined by `class` and element selectors.
- `class` selectors override styles defined by element selectors.
- Element selectors are the weakest in terms of specificity.

Additionally, you can combine selectors for more precise styling. [Read this for more](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp).

## Using a `.css` file

As a web project grows, its styles can become quite complex. To keep the code organized and easier to maintain, it's best to separate the CSS into a dedicated file and *link* it to the HTML.

In this example, we created a new file called `style.css` and moved everything that was previously inside the `<style>` and `</style>` tags into this new file.

```css showLineNumbers filename="style.css"
p {
    font-weight: bold;
}

#first-paragraph {
    color: blue;
}

.red-text {
    color: red;
}
```

In the HTML file, we removed the `<style>` and `</style>` tags and added a link to the new `.css` file. This tells the browser to apply the styles from the external file.

```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html" {7}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Alma Mater</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
    <p id="first-paragraph">I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM).</p>
    <img src="university.jpg" alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."/>
    <p class="red-text">The picture above comes from Wikimedia. You can find it <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UQAM-Judith-Jasmin.jpg">here</a> along with its license.</p>
    <p class="red-text">Montreal is a wonderful city. You should visit it!</p>
</body>
</html>
```
![A screenshot showing CSS with classes.](/assets/web-basics/css/classes.png)

As you can see, the styles are still applied. Note that you can link multiple `.css` files if needed.

## Conclusion

There is much more to learn about CSS and its [200+ properties](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/index.php), which, when combined, can create stunning visuals and even [animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).

However, this lesson was just an introduction. With these foundations, you'll be able to explore more on your own, and we will continue using CSS in future lessons and projects.

Now that we know how to structure a webpage with HTML and style it with CSS, it's time to learn how to add user interactivity! ü•≥
