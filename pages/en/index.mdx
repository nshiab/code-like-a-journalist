Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nael Shiab. I am a [computational journalist](https://www.naelshiab.com/) based in Montreal. I work for [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news) as a Senior Data Producer.

This website is a free, open-source online course on data analysis and visualization using TypeScript. It's available in English and French. I assume you know nothing about data or code, and I guide you step by step until you're ready to take off on your own.

Over the years, I have learned so much from free tutorials and open-source projects maintained by passionate people. My hope is that this course will help others in the same way.

Thanks to the support of the [Michener Awards Foundation](https://www.michenerawards.ca/media-release/michener-awards-foundation-announces-its-2024-fellowships-winners/), I took several months off from my current job to fully focus on building the course. I could also count on the support of [Jean-Hugues Roy](https://github.com/jhroy), data journalist at La Presse and former journalism professor at UQAM.
