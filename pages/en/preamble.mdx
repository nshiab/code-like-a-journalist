# Why TypeScript?

Every time I talk about this course to data-savvy acquaintances, the same question pops up: why TypeScript? Wouldn't Python or R be better?

If you're new to the data world, [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) are free and open-source programming languages traditionally used for data analysis. These languages are fantastic, backed by vibrant communities that continuously create amazing tools. I've personally enjoyed using them for years.

However, TypeScript has a major advantage: it transpiles to JavaScript, the language of the Web.

When I started my career as a computational journalist, I, like many data analysts and scientists, learned Python. Scraping data, crunching massive datasets, and deriving insights with Python was exhilarating!

But every time I wanted to share the results of my analysis, I hit a wall. To effectively communicate my findings, I needed to publish interactive data visualizations on my media outlet's website. And the web runs on JavaScript.

So, I started learning JavaScript...

For the first few years of my career, I followed a two-step workflow:

1. Gather, clean, and analyze data with Python.
2. Visualize and communicate the results with JavaScript.

This workflow required using different tools and coding environments. Often, I had to translate Python code into JavaScript (or vice versa) as projects evolved. It was tedious and time-consuming. Maintaining and improving my skills in both languages consumed a significant amount of energy.

Later, R started gaining traction within the data journalism community. I replaced Python with R for some projects, exploring its rich ecosystem. But I was still tied to JavaScript for visualization.

Meanwhile, the JavaScript ecosystem was rapidly evolving. The language received a significant upgrade with TypeScript, making it easier to handle complex code and data. JavaScript/TypeScript runtimes became more accessible and powerful, and new tools emerged to process massive datasets at remarkable speeds.

At that point, I wondered: why couldn't I do everything in TypeScript?

The main obstacle was clear: TypeScript had exceptional data visualization libraries (like [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)), but it lacked easy-to-use data analysis tools.

So, inspired by [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) in Python and the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) in R, I decided to create [simple-data-analysis](https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis).

I wrote the first lines of code in April 2022 and have been using it for [all of my projects](https://www.naelshiab.com/portfolio) ever since.

The journey was long and challenging, but now I can use TypeScript end-to-end to create my projects. And this is what I want to share with you.

My hope is that this course will make data analysis and visualization more accessible. I aim to provide everyone with the tools needed to answer important questions with data, just like computational journalists do.

So, let's code like journalists! üòÅ
