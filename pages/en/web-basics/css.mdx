# How to use CSS to style a web page

CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheets*. It tells the browser how elements on a web page should be displayed. Its syntax is simple and straightforward. It is not a programming language. There are no conditions, loops, or functions in CSS. It is just structured text that tells the browser how to display elements to the user.

Note that I assume you have completed the previous sections, especially **1. First steps üßë‚Äçüéì**, **2. Pushing further üöÄ**, and the previous lesson about [HTML](/web-basics/html).

## Setup

You don't have to install anything for this lesson. Just open an empty folder with VS Code to get started and create an `index.html` file in it. Copy and paste the code from the previous lesson in it.

```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Alma Mater</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
    <p>I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM).</p>
    <img src="university.jpg" alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."/>

```

## Syntax

### Properties and values

The CSS syntax is composed of *properties* which are assigned *values*. There are three ways of writing CSS:
- Inline, for a specific element
- Within a `style` element
- Inside a `.css` file

### Inline style

You can style directly specific HTML elements with the `style` attribute.

For example, we can style the first paragraph text `color` to `blue` and the second one to `red`. We can also change the `font-weight` to `bold.`

Note that their are many different ways to write colors in code. Here, we are using color *names*. There are around [140 of them](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php) that your browser will understand. If you want to know more about colors, check [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/default.asp).

In the style attribute, the properties and values pairs must be separated by a `;`.

```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html" /style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"/ /style="color:red; font-weight: bold;"/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Alma Mater</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
    <p style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM).</p>
    <img src="university.jpg" alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."/>
    <p style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">The picture above comes from Wikimedia. You can find it <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UQAM-Judith-Jasmin.jpg">here</a> along with its license.</p>

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
 VS Code understands some basic CSS properties and values, like colors. Here, it added a small square showing you the color we picked. But this is not part of the code. It's just a visual guide added by the code editor.

### Using the `style` element

#### Syntax and selecting elements

Inline CSS might be useful for quick and dirty projects but it's hard to maintain for long term or complex projets. If you want to keep your CSS in your HTML file, it's best to group everything with a `style` tag.

When we used inline CSS, the browser knew which element was styled. But with `style`, we need to use *selectors* to tell the browser what should be displayed how.

The syntax looks like below, with the selector first followed by properties and values pairs between curly brackets. For example, the code below tells the browser to change the style of all `p` elements on the page by making them all bold.

```css showLineNumbers
p {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

#### `id` selectors

Let's update our previous code to use the `style` element. Since this is just to tell the browser how to display elements, we keep it in the `head`.

```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html" {7-19} /id="first-paragraph"/ /id="second-paragraph"/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Alma Mater</title>
    <style>
        p {
            font-weight: bold;
        }

        #first-paragraph {
            color: blue;
        }

        #second-paragraph {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
    <p id="first-paragraph">I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM).</p>
    <img src="university.jpg" alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."/>
    <p id="second-paragraph">The picture above comes from Wikimedia. You can find it <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UQAM-Judith-Jasmin.jpg">here</a> along with its license.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
![A screenshot showing CSS within a `style` element.](/assets/web-basics/css/style.png)

Have you noticed the `#first-paragraph` (line 12) and `#second-paragraph` (line 16) selectors? And the `id` attributes (line 23 and 25)?

Since we want all of our `p` to be bold, we can use the `p` selector for `font-weight: bold`. But we want the first paragraph to be blue and the second paragraph to be red, so we use `id`s.

In the HTML, we specify the id `first-paragraph` and `second-paragraph`. This allows us to select the specific paragraphs in the CSS with `#first-paragraph` and `#second-paragraph` selectors (notice the `#`).

Note that you are not supposed to have the same `id` repeated multiple times on your page.

#### `class` selectors

The element selectors (like `p`) targets all elements on the page. For example, all `p` styled to be bold.

On the opposite, the `id`s are great to target one specific element.

But what should you use when you want to target multiple elements, but not all of them? The answer is `class`es.

For example, let's add a third paragraph and let's say we want the last two paragraphs to be red.

```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html" {16-18, 26} /class="red-text"/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Alma Mater</title>
    <style>
        p {
            font-weight: bold;
        }

        #first-paragraph {
            color: blue;
        }

        .red-text {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
    <p id="first-paragraph">I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM).</p>
    <img src="university.jpg" alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."/>
    <p class="red-text">The picture above comes from Wikimedia. You can find it <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UQAM-Judith-Jasmin.jpg">here</a> along with its license.</p>
    <p class="red-text">Montreal is a wonderful city. You should visit it!</p>
</body>
</html>
```
![A screenshot showing CSS with classes.](/assets/web-basics/css/classes.png)

In the code above, we replaced the `id` attribute and the property `second-paragraph` with a `class` attribute with the `red-text` value.

So now we are able to use the class selector `.red-text` (note the `.`) to modify the style of all elements with this `class` (the last two paragraphs here).

You can add the classes to as many elements as you want.

#### More about selectors

If you want to overwrite a property and its value, you must be aware of the selectors hierarchy:
- Inline styles can overwrite any styles defined by any selector
- `id` selectors can overwrite any styles defnined by `class` and element selectors
- `class` selectors can overwrite any styles defined by element selectors
- element selectors are one of the weakest selectors

It's also important to know that you can combine selectors. [Read this for more](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp).

## Conclusion

There is much more to learn about CSS and its [200+ properties](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/index.php) that, combined together, can create stunning visuals and even [animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).

But this lesson was just an overview. With these fondations, you'll be able to explore more by yourself and we will aslo use CSS in the next lessons and projects.

Now that we know how to structure a webpage with HTML and style it with CSS, it's time to learn how to add user interactivity to it! ü•≥
