# Geospatial analysis with the Simple Data Analysis library

In this lesson, we will learn how to use the open-source library I created: [simple-data-analysis](https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis). We will analyze wildfires in Canadian provinces. The question we will answer is:

- How much have wildfires burnt in each Canadian province in 2023?

To do that, we will convert a CSV file with the latitude and longitude of wildfires to point geometries, open a geojson file containing the provinces boundaries, and do a spatial join to check which fire is in which province.

If you have a minute, please add a ‚≠ê to the library's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis). It's always nice to know your open-source work is appreciated. üòä

Note that I expect you to have at least completed the **First steps üßë‚Äçüéì** and **Pushing further üöÄ** sections, as the previous lesson about [Tabular data lesson](/simple-data-analysis/tabular-data) from the current section.

## Setup

As we did in the previous lesson, create a new folder on your computer and run command: `deno -A jsr:@nshiab/setup-sda`

After running the command, your terminal will display a description of the created files and installed libraries.

Run the suggested task to run and watch our code: `deno task sda`
