# Classes

Maybe you noticed that we use the keyword `new` from time to time. For example, to create a new date, we need to write `new Date()`. That's because `Date` is a `class`.

Just like functions, classes are another staple of programming. They are very convenient for organizing your code, with their own properties and functions (called methods).

To be honest, classes are a bit advanced, and you probably won't create classes right away. But you'll use pre-coded classes quite often (just like `new Date()`), so it's important to have a rough idea of how they work.

Note that I expect you to have completed the previous lessons, especially the one about **[Functions](/pushing-further/functions)**.

Let's dive into it!

<NoticeIntro />

## Setup

Make a new folder somewhere on your computer, open it with VS Code, and create two files:

- `main.ts`, where we will write our code. To start, you can add `console.log("Hello!");` to it.
- `deno.json`, which lets VS Code know this is a Deno project and enables the Deno extension. You can tweak settings in this file, but we'll keep it empty for now.

Open the terminal and run the following command: `deno run --watch main.ts`

This command clears the terminal and reruns `main.ts` every time you save it (`CMD` + `S` on Mac or `CTRL` + `S` on PC).

You can use this setup to test the code provided in this lesson.

## Creating a class

To create a class, you need to declare it with the `class` keyword, followed by its name and curly brackets `{}`. By convention, class names are capitalized.

Let's create a class named `Person`.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
class Person {
}
```

## Instantiating a class

To use the class, we need to create an **instance** of it by calling it with the `new` operator, followed by the class name and `()`. You can create as many instances of a class as you want.

Below, we instantiate our class `Person` twice. We store the new instances in the variables `john` and `emily`.

We now have two `Person` instances in our code.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {4, 5}
class Person {
}

const john = new Person();
const emily = new Person();
```

## Properties and constructor

So far, our class `Person` is empty. We can give our `Person` instances `name` and `age` properties.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {2, 3}
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const john = new Person();
const emily = new Person();
```
Now, the class `Person` has two properties, but they are not assigned. It would be great to give `john` and `emily` a `name` and `age` when instantiating them.

To do that, you need to use the class `constructor`. The constructor looks like a function, but without the `function` keyword. It's called when you instantiate the class (and only then).

We can give the `constructor` parameters (here, `name` and `age`). By using the `this` keyword, we can assign the parameters to the properties.

It's now possible to pass arguments when we instantiate the class. We created just one class, but `john` and `emily` now each have their own `name` and `age`. And of course, everything is typed, so the code editor will help you out with autocomplete and will make sure you're passing the right data types. Magic! 🪄✨

You can access class instance properties just like you would with objects, using a `.`.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {5-8, 14-15} /"john", 30/ /"emily", 35/
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

const john = new Person("john", 30);
const emily = new Person("emily", 35);

console.log(john.name, john.age);
console.log(emily.name, emily.age);
```

## Methods

Methods are functions specifically created for a class. They are very useful because they have direct access to the class properties. They also have access to other methods, so a method can call another method. But this is getting meta. 🥸

Methods are written like functions, but without the `function` keyword. You have to declare them inside the class. A class can have as many methods as you want.

For example, let's create a method called `makeOlder`. Each time it's called, it will add `1` to the `age` property.

To call a method, use `.` right after an instance or a variable storing an instance, then type the name of the method followed by `()`.

Below, we call the `makeOlder` method three times on `john`. We instantiated him with an `age` of `30`, but when we log his `age`, it's now `33`!

And since all instances are independent, `emily` is still `35`! Of course, `emily` also has the `makeOlder` method. Feel free to test it!


```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {10-12, 18-20}
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  makeOlder() {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
  }
}

const john = new Person("john", 30);
const emily = new Person("emily", 35);

john.makeOlder();
john.makeOlder();
john.makeOlder();

console.log(john.name, john.age);
console.log(emily.name, emily.age);
```
![Using methods.](/assets/pushing-further/classes/method.png)

Calling the method `makeOlder` three times is not very convenient. Just like functions, methods can have parameters. Let's update our code to pass a number of years to the method.

Just like function parameters, method parameters are typed, which is very convenient and helps you avoid typos and bugs.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {18} /year: number/ /+ year/
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  makeOlder(year: number) {
    this.age = this.age + year;
  }
}

const john = new Person("john", 30);
const emily = new Person("emily", 35);

john.makeOlder(3);

console.log(john.name, john.age);
console.log(emily.name, emily.age);
```
![Using methods with parameters.](/assets/pushing-further/classes/method-parameter.png)

Instead of using `console.log` and manually passing the instance properties, we could also create another method to log the ages.

As you can see, classes — with their properties and methods — can be a great way to organize your code!


```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {14-16, 24-25}
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  makeOlder(year: number) {
    this.age = this.age + year;
  }

  log() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const john = new Person("john", 30);
const emily = new Person("emily", 35);

john.makeOlder(3);

emily.log();
john.log();
```
![Using another method.](/assets/pushing-further/classes/log-method.png)

## Exporting and importing

Just like functions, it's pretty common to keep classes in their own file and export/import them.

Create a new file called `Person.ts` and move your class into it. Don’t forget to add `export default` in front of it to make it available to the rest of your scripts.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="Person.ts" /export default/
export default class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  makeOlder(year: number) {
    this.age = this.age + year;
  }

  log() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}
```

And now you can easily import it and use it in `main.ts`, which is now much simpler and easier to understand!


```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {1}
import Person from "./Person.ts";

const john = new Person("john", 30);
const emily = new Person("emily", 35);

john.makeOlder(3);

emily.log();
john.log();
```

## Documentation

Just like functions, you can document your classes using the **JSDoc** syntax.

Below, I have documented the class as well as all its methods. For each one, I added an example. Now, the documentation will pop up in VS Code when you start typing their names or when hovering over them. Very convenient!


```ts showLineNumbers filename="People.ts"
/**
 * Represents a person with a name and age.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const person = new Person('John', 30);
 * ````
 */
export default class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  /**
   * Increases the age of the person by a specified number of years.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * person.makeOlder(5);
   * ```
   *
   * @param year - The number of years to add to the person's age.
   */
  makeOlder(year: number) {
    this.age = this.age + year;
  }

  /**
   * Logs a message to the console with the person's name and age.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * person.log();
   * ```
   */
  log() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You wrote your first class! While you might not create a lot of them for your analyses and future projects, you will use a looooooot of them! And as you just saw, using them is very easy. 🤗

There’s a lot more to learn about classes — like inheritance, for example. But if you ever need to dive into that, it’ll mean you’ve become quite a good TypeScript coder! And by then, you’ll be able to read [more technical documentation](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-inheritance/) and understand it.

And if not, well, you can always [reach out to me](/contact). I’ll be happy to write another lesson! 😁
