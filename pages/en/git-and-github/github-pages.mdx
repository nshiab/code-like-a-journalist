# Publishing on GitHub pages with Svelte

In previous lessons, we've learned how to use GitHub to run code with GitHub Actions. There is another amazing feature of GitHub I wanted to share with you: **Pages**.

If you tell GitHub where are located static files for a website in a repository, it will automatically create a website with them, for free! Pages are often used to host library documentation, but they can be anything you want!

In this lesson, I am going to show you how to use the [setup-sda library](https://github.com/nshiab/setup-sda) we've been using in many previous projects to (very) quickly publish your data projects on GitHub.

If you haven't done so, I suggest you check the **[Svelte lesson](/web-basics/svelte)**, since we are going to use it to build our website.

<NoticeIntro />

## Setup

Create a new folder and open it in VS Code. Then run this command to install and set up everything we need with [setup-sda](https://github.com/nshiab/setup-sda):
- `deno -A jsr:@nshiab/setup-sda --svelte --example --pages --git`

The library sets up a `sda` folder to work with the [Simple Data Analysis library](https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis), as we saw in [**3.Â TheÂ SDAÂ libraryÂ ðŸ¤“**](simple-data-analysis/tabular-data). But the options add a few things:
- `--svelte` will also set up a Svelte project
- `--example` will add data and code to show a full project example
- `--pages` will add a GitHub workflow (as we saw in the [previous lesson](/git-and-github/github-actions)) and tweak some configuration files
- `--git` will initialize and make the first commit once all files are in.

Once the command ran, you can execture `deno task dev`, open the local URL and you should see an example website! Feel free to explore the code and the page.

## Creating a repository

It's now time to head over GitHub and create a new repository. Give it a name (`my-website` for example), make it public, and there is no need for a `README` and `.gitignore` since `setup-sda` took care of all that.

Now copy the commands to *push an existing repository from the command line**.

![Git commands.](/assets/git-and-github/github-pages/commands.png)

And paste and run them in your repository.

Now, if you refresh your repository page, you'll your code!

## Enabling GitHub Pages

Now, it's time to enable GitHub pages on the repository!

Click on your repository `Settings` and then on `Pages` on the left side-bar. Then select `GitHub Actions` for the `Build and deployment` source.

Now, go check your actions. We have one to build and deploy our website. But it failed because GitHub Pages was not enabled when we did our first push. Click on it.

Click on `Rerun jobs` and wait for a few seconds.

And now it works! GitHub Actions successfully did the two jobs: building our website and then publishing it! You now have a link for your website!

If you click on the link, you'll see your website live!

You can retrieve the link to the website in your settings too.

## Updating `main`

Now, let's do something fun. Let's update the code on the `main` branch and push it to GitHub.

In `src/routes/+page.svelte`, I changed `<h2>Climate change</h2>` to `<h2>Climate change example</h2>`. I know, I am going crazy.

Let's commit and push this to GitHub:
- `git add -A`
- `git commit -m "Update"`
- `git push`

![Making a change.](/assets/git-and-github/github-pages/change.png)

If you check your actions, you'll see one being triggered by your push. Everytime you update the `main` branch, your site will be rebuilt and republished! Magic! ðŸ§™

PS: I have two `Update` in the screenshot because I messed up. But you should have just one!

![The workflow being triggered.](/assets/git-and-github/github-pages/update-action.png)

And after a few seconds, your website will be updated!

![The website being updated.](/assets/git-and-github/github-pages/update-website.png)

With this setup, you can focus on your code, work on branches, see your website locally as you work on it and when happy, make a pull request to merge on main.

Once merged, you website will automatically be republished! ðŸ¤©

## But... how?

That was easy, wasn't it? ðŸ¥³ To make it work, there are a few things `setup-sda` did for us.

In the `svelte.config.js` file, it set up a `paths.base` to make sure Svelte knows that the website address will start with something like `https//your-username.github.io/my-website/`. This information will be passed with an environment variable in the GitHub workflow.

```js showLineNumbers filename="svelte.config.js" {3, 10-12}
import adapter from "@sveltejs/adapter-static";
import { vitePreprocess } from "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte";
import process from "node:process";

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  preprocess: vitePreprocess(),
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter(),
    paths: {
      base: process.argv.includes("dev") ? "" : process.env.BASE_PATH,
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

The next big thing is the GitHub Actions workflow, of course.

In `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, many things are happening and if you want to fully understand them, check the [GitHub Actions lesson](/git-and-github/github-actions).

But to summarize, there are two jobs here that are triggered when there is a push on main:
- `build_site` which builds the website by passing an environment variable `github.event.repository.name` (used in our `svelte.config.js` covered just above)
- `deploy` which publishes the files created by `build_site`.

```yml showLineNumbers filename=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: "main"

jobs:
  build_site:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Deno
        uses: denoland/setup-deno@v2
        with:
          deno-version: v2.x

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: deno install

      - name: build
        env:
          BASE_PATH: "/${{ github.event.repository.name }}"
        run: deno task build

      - name: Upload Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: "build/"

  deploy:
    needs: build_site
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write

    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

# Conclusion

I hope you'll find this setup useful. I created `setup_sda` to make my life easier. With it, I can crunch and analyse data with the `Simple Data Analysis` library in the `sda` folder and then work on interactive visualizations in the folder `src` with `Svelte`. It's the best of both world!

And with GitHub pages, I can easily share my findings to the world. And now that you completed this lesson, you can too!

Let me know if you use it! ðŸ¤—
