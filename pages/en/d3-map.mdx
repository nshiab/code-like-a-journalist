# Animated maps with D3.js üó∫Ô∏è

As we've seen in the [previous lesson](/d3-chart), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is an amazing library to build charts. But it also excels at making maps.

In this project, we will use earthquake data to create an animated map with D3 and Svelte, as shown below. I strongly suggest completing the previous sections of the course before diving in, especially [Animated charts with D3.js üßë‚Äçüé®](/d3-chart).

## Setup

We will use [setup-sda](https://github.com/nshiab/setup-sda) to set up and install everything we need.

Open a new folder with VS Code and run `deno -A jsr:@nshiab/setup-sda --svelte`.

## Earthquake data and country boundaries

To retrieve earthquake data, I used the [USGS Earthquake Catalog](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/). Since 2021 appeared to be a very active year, I downloaded two CSV files for this year and pushed the files to GitHub. This is the same data as the [previous D3 project](/d3-chart).

For the country boundaries, I downloaded them from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) as a zipped shapefile.

Using the Simple Data Analysis library in the `sda` folder, we can easily retrieve and cache them. Update `sda/main.ts`, then run `deno task sda` to execute and watch it.

For the earthquakes:
- We make sure to convert the `time` values to dates.
- We keep only rows with a `type` of `earthquake` and a `status` of `reviewed`.
- We filter out earthquakes with a magnitude less than 5.
- Since we will be drawing circles on our map, it's more interesting to use the amplitude, which we can easily compute from the magnitude.
- We rename `latitude` and `longitude` to shorter names.
- We keep only the columns that we will be using: `time`, `ampl`, `lat`, and `lon`.
- We round numerical values to three decimal places.
- On our map, we want the bigger earthquakes to appear on top of the smaller ones, so we sort `ampl` in ascending order, as D3 draws elements in the order they appear in the data.
- After logging the table to ensure everything is okay, we write the data to a JSON file in the `src` folder (not `sda`) to be used in our Svelte project. Since these are just points, it's easier to keep this data tabular. We have over 2,000 earthquakes that we want to draw and animate on a map.

For the countries:
- When fetching the data with `loadDataGeo`, we make sure to reproject the data to `WGS84`.
- We select only the `geom` column, since we don't need anything more than the boundaries.
- After logging the table to make sure everything is okay, we write a GeoJSON file to the `src` folder (not `sda`) to be used in our Svelte project. Here, we use `writeGeoData` instead of `writeData`, and we pass the option `rewind` to make sure the coordinates are in the right order for D3 to draw the polygons correctly. We have 127 geospatial features that we will add to our map.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="sda/main.ts"
import { SimpleDB } from "@nshiab/simple-data-analysis";

const sdb = new SimpleDB();

const earthquakes = sdb.newTable("earthquakes");
await earthquakes.cache(async () => {
  await earthquakes.loadData([
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/earthquakes-2021-1.csv",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/earthquakes-2021-2.csv",
  ]);
});

await earthquakes.convert({ time: "datetime" });
await earthquakes.keep({
  "type": "earthquake",
  "status": "reviewed",
});
await earthquakes.filter(`mag >= 5`);
await earthquakes.addColumn("ampl", "number", `POW(10, mag)`);
await earthquakes.renameColumns({ latitude: "lat", longitude: "lon" });
await earthquakes.selectColumns([
  "time",
  "ampl",
  "lat",
  "lon",

await earthquakes.round(["ampl", "lat", "lon"], { decimals: 3 });
await earthquakes.removeDuplicates();
await earthquakes.sort({ ampl: "asc" });
await earthquakes.logTable();
await earthquakes.writeData("src/data/earthquakes.json");

const countries = sdb.newTable("countries");
await countries.cache(async () => {
  await countries.loadGeoData(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/ne_110m_land.shp.zip",
    { toWGS84: true },
  );
});
await countries.selectColumns("geom");
await countries.logTable();
await countries.writeGeoData("src/data/countries.json", { rewind: true });

await sdb.done();
```

## Exploratory dataviz

Before diving into D3 code, I always use SDA and [Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) to quickly draw an initial dataviz. It helps to understand the data at hand.

Since we have data for the whole world, we can try the [`equal-earth`](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326879978_The_Equal_Earth_map_projection) projection, which is also available in D3. (More on projections below.)

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the new code below:
- We clone the earthquakes table.
- We create point geometries from the `lat` and `lon` columns into a new `geom` column.
- We insert the countries table, which already has a `geom` column.
- We use the `writeMap` method with Plot to export a map as a PNG file.
- We add `sphere()` and `graticule()` to make the map easier to interpret with the `equal-earth` projection.
- We draw the countries first.
- Then we draw the earthquakes, using their `ampl` values.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="sda/main.ts" {2, 45-66}
import { SimpleDB } from "@nshiab/simple-data-analysis";
import { geo, graticule, plot, sphere } from "@observablehq/plot";

const sdb = new SimpleDB();

const earthquakes = sdb.newTable("earthquakes");
await earthquakes.cache(async () => {
  await earthquakes.loadData([
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/earthquakes-2021-1.csv",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/earthquakes-2021-2.csv",
  ]);
});

await earthquakes.convert({ time: "datetime" });
await earthquakes.keep({
  "type": "earthquake",
  "status": "reviewed",
});
await earthquakes.filter(`mag >= 5`);
await earthquakes.addColumn("ampl", "number", `POW(10, mag)`);
await earthquakes.renameColumns({ latitude: "lat", longitude: "lon" });
await earthquakes.selectColumns([
  "time",
  "ampl",
  "lat",
  "lon",
]);
await earthquakes.round(["ampl", "lat", "lon"], { decimals: 3 });
await earthquakes.removeDuplicates();
await earthquakes.sort({ ampl: "asc" });
await earthquakes.logTable();
await earthquakes.writeData("src/data/earthquakes.json");

const countries = sdb.newTable("countries");
await countries.cache(async () => {
  await countries.loadGeoData(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/ne_110m_land.shp.zip",
    { toWGS84: true },
  );
});
await countries.selectColumns("geom");
await countries.logTable();
await countries.writeGeoData("src/data/countries.json", { rewind: true });

const earthquakesAndCountries = await earthquakes.cloneTable({
  outputTable: "earthquakesAndCountries",
});
await earthquakesAndCountries.points("lat", "lon", "geom");
await earthquakesAndCountries.insertTables(countries);
await earthquakesAndCountries.writeMap((geodata) =>
  plot({
    projection: "equal-earth",
    marks: [
      sphere(),
      graticule(),
      geo(geodata.features.filter((d) => !d.properties.ampl)),
      geo(
        geodata.features.filter((d) => typeof d.properties.ampl === "number"),
        {
          r: "ampl",
          fill: "red",
          opacity: 0.5,
        },
      ),
    ],
  }), "sda/output/earthquakesAndCountries.png");

await sdb.done();
```

Things are looking quite good! We can now dive into our Svelte project.

## Svelte component

Let's set up a new Svelte component with a helper function for our map.

But before we do, it‚Äôs always helpful to define some types that we‚Äôll use repeatedly. In `src/lib/index.ts`, we can place types and variables that will be easily accessible throughout our Svelte project.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/lib/index.ts"
type earthquake = {
  time: Date;
  lat: number;
  lon: number;
  ampl: number;
};

export type { earthquake };
```

Now let's create the helper function `drawMap.ts` in the `src/helpers` folder (again, not `sda`). This is where our D3 code will live. The function will need a few things:
- An `id`, which will be the `id` of the `svg` element where we will draw our map.
- The `earthquakes` data.
- The `width` and `height` of the map.

For now, let's just log the parameters.

Note that since we used `src/lib/index.ts`, we can easily import our types (and anything else we put in there) with `from $lib`. It's a handy shortcut!


```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/helpers/drawMap.ts"
import type { earthquake } from "$lib";

export default function drawMap(
  id: string,
  earthquakes: earthquake[],
  width: number,
  height: number,
) {
  console.log({ id, earthquakes, width, height });
}
```

We can now create a new `Map.svelte` component that:

- Imports our `earthquakes.json` data as `earthquakesRaw` (line 2), and maps over it to convert the `time` values back to `Date` objects (lines 7‚Äì10).
- Retrieves the `id` as `props` (line 5).
- Creates `width` and `height` states (lines 12‚Äì13) and binds them to the `clientWidth` and `clientHeight` of the `svg` element where we will draw our chart (line 21). We‚Äôll talk more about `svg` elements later on.
- Uses the [`$effect` rune](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$effect) to call `drawMap` with all the props and states. This means Svelte will recall `drawMap` if any of the arguments change, including `width` and `height`, making the map responsive.
- To keep a constant aspect ratio for our map, we wrap the `svg` in a `div` and use `style` tags to set the `div` width to `100%` and the `svg` aspect ratio to `16/9`.


```svelte showLineNumbers filename="src/components/Map.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
    import earthquakesRaw from "../data/earthquakes.json";
    import drawMap from "../helpers/drawMap";

    const { id }: { id: string } = $props();

    const earthquakes = earthquakesRaw.map((d) => ({
        ...d,
        time: new Date(d.time),
    }));

    let width = $state(0);
    let height = $state(0);

    $effect(() => {
        drawMap(id, earthquakes, width, height);
    });
</script>

<div>
    <svg {id} bind:clientWidth={width} bind:clientHeight={height}></svg>
</div>

<style>
    div {
        width: 100%;
    }
    svg {
        aspect-ratio: 16/9;
    }
</style>
```

And finally, we can import our new `<Map />` component on our page, which is `src/routes/+page.svelte`. We set an appropriate `id`. While we're at it, we can update the text.

If you were still watching `sda/main.ts` in your terminal, you can stop it (`CTRL + C`) and run `deno task dev` instead to start a local server. Open the URL provided in your terminal in your favorite web browser.

In your browser‚Äôs console, you should see the log from `drawMap.ts`. We‚Äôre ready to code our map!

```svelte showLineNumbers filename="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
    import Map from "../components/Map.svelte";
</script>

<h1>Earthquakes</h1>
<p>
    The data used below includes only earthquakes with a magnitude of 5 or more
    that occurred in 2021.
</p>
<Map id="earthquakes" />
```

## Drawing a map with D3

Let's play with D3 now!

Stop your local server (`CTRL + C`) and install D3 with `deno add npm:d3`. Then rerun your local server with `deno task dev`.

In the previous lesson, we learned about D3 `scales`, which can convert data values to pixel values, colors, and more.

When working with maps, we need to do the same thing for geospatial coordinates (latitude and longitude): convert them to pixels. But... there's a trick. The Earth is round, while our screens (and paper maps) are flat!

This is why cartographers created **projections**, which are kind of like scales, but for maps. Each projection and its mathematical calculations come with pros and cons. For example, the [Mercator projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection) ‚Äî probably the best-known of all ‚Äî is great for navigation because directions are preserved, but distances and areas are distorted in northern and southern regions.

One reason why D3 is so great for maps is that you get easy access to [a looooot of projections](https://observablehq.com/@fil/d3-projections). In this project, we'll use the `geoEqualEarth()` projection, like we did with Plot at the beginning.

Let's update `drawMap.ts` to use it. Here's what the new code does, step by step:
- We select the `svg` in which we‚Äôll draw our map, and remove any existing content to avoid stacking elements between renders (lines 10‚Äì11).
- We create a `sphere` that will contain the entire map (lines 13‚Äì15). It doesn‚Äôt have coordinates, and that‚Äôs okay ‚Äî D3 knows how to handle it. We‚Äôll provide coordinates for the other features on the map.
- We call the `geoEqualEarth` projection and use the `fitSize` method to ensure our map fits the `width` and `height` of the `svg`. We also pass in our `sphere` to ensure proper positioning. If we wanted to zoom in on a country, we could pass that country instead of the `sphere`. We store the projection in the `projection` variable.
- We call `geoPath` and pass it our `projection`. The result, stored in `geoGenerator`, is a function that can draw shapes based on latitudes and longitudes.
- We append a `path` to the `svg`, which will represent a shape.
- In the previous lesson, we used `.data()` to bind an array of objects. But here, since we have just one item (`sphere`), we use `.datum()` instead.
- We set the `d` attribute (which defines the shape of a `path`) using the `geoGenerator` function. It reads the bound data and translates it to coordinates ‚Äî for now, it simply fills the map background.
- Finally, we set other attributes, such as the `fill` color.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/helpers/drawMap.ts" {10-25}
import type { earthquake } from "$lib";
import { geoEqualEarth, geoPath, select } from "d3";

export default function drawMap(
  id: string,
  earthquakes: earthquake[],
  width: number,
  height: number,
) {
  const svg = select(`#${id}`);
  svg.selectAll("*").remove();

  const sphere = {
    type: "Sphere",
  };
  const projection = geoEqualEarth()
    .fitSize([width, height], sphere);

  const geoGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection);

  svg
    .append("path")
    .datum(sphere)
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "black");
}
```

If you right-click on the black area and inspect it in your web browser, you'll see your `svg` with a `path`. The `path` has a `d` attribute containing SVG coordinates generated by our code!

![A sphere created with D3.](/assets/d3-map/sphere.png)

To make our map easier to read, we can also add [graticules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graticule_(cartography)). The `geoGraticule()` function generates a GeoJSON object with graticule coordinates.

We place them after our sphere in the code to ensure they are drawn on top of it. To give them a light grey appearance, we draw them as white lines with reduced opacity.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/helpers/drawMap.ts" {2, 27-33}
import type { earthquake } from "$lib";
import { geoEqualEarth, geoGraticule, geoPath, select } from "d3";

export default function drawMap(
  id: string,
  earthquakes: earthquake[],
  width: number,
  height: number,
) {
  const svg = select(`#${id}`);
  svg.selectAll("*").remove();

  const sphere = {
    type: "Sphere",
  };
  const projection = geoEqualEarth()
    .fitSize([width, height], sphere);

  const geoGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection);

  svg
    .append("path")
    .datum(sphere)
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "black");

  svg
    .append("path")
    .datum(geoGraticule())
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "none")
    .attr("stroke", "white")
    .attr("opacity", 0.3);
}
```
![Graticules created with D3.](/assets/d3-map/graticules.png)

Now would be a good time to add the countries to our map. Since we‚Äôre not interested in showing the actual borders, we can simply fill them in with grey, without any stroke.

There are over 100 of them, so we use the `.data(countries.features)` and `.join("path")` syntax to bind the data to new `path` elements. To make sure we don‚Äôt accidentally select previous paths, we use `selectAll` with the `.countries` class, which we set as an attribute.

We use `.features` in `.data(countries.features)` because the file is written as a GeoJSON object, where all the features are stored in a list under the `features` key.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/helpers/drawMap.ts" {3, 36-41}
import type { earthquake } from "$lib";
import { geoEqualEarth, geoGraticule, geoPath, select } from "d3";
import countries from "../data/countries.json" with { type: "json" };

export default function drawMap(
  id: string,
  earthquakes: earthquake[],
  width: number,
  height: number,
) {
  const svg = select(`#${id}`);
  svg.selectAll("*").remove();

  const sphere = {
    type: "Sphere",
  };
  const projection = geoEqualEarth()
    .fitSize([width, height], sphere);

  const geoGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection);

  svg
    .append("path")
    .datum(sphere)
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "black");

  svg
    .append("path")
    .datum(geoGraticule())
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "none")
    .attr("stroke", "white")
    .attr("opacity", 0.3);

  svg.selectAll(".countries")
    .data(countries.features)
    .join("path")
    .attr("class", "countries")
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "grey");
}
```
![Countries on a map created with D3.](/assets/d3-map/countries.png)

The only thing left is the earthquakes!

There are a few things we need to take care of to show them properly:
- We use the `extent` function to retrieve the minimum and maximum of the `ampl` values (lines 51‚Äì54). This function returns an array like `[min, max]`.
- We create a scale for the `r` attribute (lines 56‚Äì58). We use a square root scale (`scaleSqrt`) because we want the *area* of the circle to be proportional to the data. We set its domain to the `ampl` extent and its range to radii between 2 and 20 pixels.
- We create a color scale, also tied to the `ampl` extent, going from yellow to red (lines 60‚Äì61).

With the scales in place, and the projection set up earlier, we can now create circles for our earthquakes. For `cx` and `cy`, we pass the `lon` and `lat` (in that order) to the `projection`. It returns the pixel values as `[x, y]`, which we use to position the circles on the map.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/helpers/drawMap.ts" {3, 7, 8, 51-69}
import type { earthquake } from "$lib";
import {
  extent,
  geoEqualEarth,
  geoGraticule,
  geoPath,
  scaleLinear,
  scaleSqrt,
  select,
} from "d3";
import countries from "../data/countries.json" with { type: "json" };

export default function drawMap(
  id: string,
  earthquakes: earthquake[],
  width: number,
  height: number,
) {
  const svg = select(`#${id}`);
  svg.selectAll("*").remove();

  const sphere = {
    type: "Sphere",
  };
  const projection = geoEqualEarth()
    .fitSize([width, height], sphere);

  const geoGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection);

  svg
    .append("path")
    .datum(sphere)
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "black");

  svg
    .append("path")
    .datum(geoGraticule())
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "none")
    .attr("stroke", "white")
    .attr("opacity", 0.3);

  svg.selectAll(".countries")
    .data(countries.features)
    .join("path")
    .attr("class", "countries")
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "grey");

  const amplExtent = extent(
    earthquakes,
    (d: earthquake) => d.ampl,
  );

  const rScale = scaleSqrt()
    .domain(amplExtent)
    .range([2, 20]);

  const colorScale = scaleLinear().domain(amplExtent)
    .range(["yellow", "red"]);

  svg.selectAll("circle")
    .data(earthquakes)
    .join("circle")
    .attr("cx", (d: earthquake) => projection([d.lon, d.lat])[0])
    .attr("cy", (d: earthquake) => projection([d.lon, d.lat])[1])
    .attr("r", (d: earthquake) => rScale(d.ampl))
    .attr("fill", (d: earthquake) => colorScale(d.ampl));
}
```
![Earthquakes on a map created with D3.](/assets/d3-map/earthquakes.png)

Look at that! Isn't it beautiful? We plotted 2,000+ earthquakes on a map, with continents and graticules, using a fancy projection! ü•≥

## Animating a map

Now, how can we animate this map? It would be great to show the earthquakes as time goes by.

First, let's create a `button` with a state called `animate`. When we click the button, we want the state to toggle between `true` and `false`. And of course, we pass this new state to our `drawMap` function.

The `drawMap` function will also need an `animationDuration` (10s for now) and a `transitionDuration` (500ms). The first defines the total length of the animation, while the second controls the duration of each circle's animation. Since we don‚Äôt expect these values to change, we can simply define them as constant variables.

We can also go ahead and plan for a new paragraph that will display the current date of the animation. We‚Äôll set its CSS `display` property to `inline` so it appears on the same line as the button.


```svelte showLineNumbers filename="src/components/Map.svelte" {15-17, 25-27, 32-37, 49-51}
<script lang="ts">
    import earthquakesRaw from "../data/earthquakes.json";
    import drawMap from "../helpers/drawMap";

    const { id }: { id: string } = $props();

    const earthquakes = earthquakesRaw.map((d) => ({
        ...d,
        time: new Date(d.time),
    }));

    let width = $state(0);
    let height = $state(0);

    let animate = $state(false);
    const animationDuration = 10000;
    const transitionDuration = 500;

    $effect(() => {
        drawMap(
            id,
            earthquakes,
            width,
            height,
            animate,
            animationDuration,
            transitionDuration,
        );
    });
</script>

<button
    onclick={() => {
        animate = !animate;
    }}>{animate ? "Stop ‚èπ" : "Play ‚èµ"}</button
>
<p id={`${id}-date`}></p>
<div>
    <svg {id} bind:clientWidth={width} bind:clientHeight={height}></svg>
</div>

<style>
    div {
        width: 100%;
    }
    svg {
        aspect-ratio: 16/9;
    }
    p {
        display: inline;
    }
</style>
```

Now we can work on our `drawMap` function. Let's retrieve the new `animate` parameter and use it. If `animate` is `true`, we'll draw the earthquakes. Otherwise, we won‚Äôt.

We‚Äôll use `animationDuration` and `transitionDuration` later.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/helpers/drawMap.ts" {18-20, 54, 74}
import type { earthquake } from "$lib";
import {
  extent,
  geoEqualEarth,
  geoGraticule,
  geoPath,
  scaleLinear,
  scaleSqrt,
  select,
} from "d3";
import countries from "../data/countries.json" with { type: "json" };

export default function drawMap(
  id: string,
  earthquakes: earthquake[],
  width: number,
  height: number,
  animate: boolean,
  animationDuration: number,
  transitionDuration: number,
) {
  const svg = select(`#${id}`);
  svg.selectAll("*").remove();

  const sphere = {
    type: "Sphere",
  };
  const projection = geoEqualEarth()
    .fitSize([width, height], sphere);

  const geoGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection);

  svg
    .append("path")
    .datum(sphere)
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "black");

  svg
    .append("path")
    .datum(geoGraticule())
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "none")
    .attr("stroke", "white")

  svg.selectAll(".countries")
    .data(countries.features)
    .join("path")
    .attr("class", "countries")
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "grey");

  if (animate) {
    const amplExtent = extent(
      earthquakes,
      (d: earthquake) => d.ampl,
    );

    const rScale = scaleSqrt()
      .domain(amplExtent)
      .range([2, 20]);

    const colorScale = scaleLinear().domain(amplExtent)
      .range(["yellow", "red"]);

    svg.selectAll("circle")
      .data(earthquakes)
      .join("circle")
      .attr("cx", (d: earthquake) => projection([d.lon, d.lat])[0])
      .attr("cy", (d: earthquake) => projection([d.lon, d.lat])[1])
      .attr("r", (d: earthquake) => rScale(d.ampl))
      .attr("fill", (d: earthquake) => colorScale(d.ampl));
  }
}
```

This was easy ‚Äî and we‚Äôre on the right path! Now we can focus on creating an animation with D3.

![Toggling earthquakes on a map created with D3.](/assets/d3-map/start-stop.gif)

One way to reveal elements one after the other with D3 is by using `.transition()` with `.delay()`. We could first draw the circles with an `r` of `0`, then give each a delay based on its `time` value. Once the delay expires, we could use `.transition()` again to increase the `r` to its actual size.

If you want to learn more about D3 transitions, be sure to check the previous lesson: [Animated charts with D3.js üßë‚Äçüé®](/d3-chart)

And how can we compute the right delay for each circle? With a scale, of course!

Let‚Äôs code that!

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/helpers/drawMap.ts" {67-72, 80-84}
import type { earthquake } from "$lib";
import {
  extent,
  geoEqualEarth,
  geoGraticule,
  geoPath,
  scaleLinear,
  scaleSqrt,
  select,
} from "d3";
import countries from "../data/countries.json" with { type: "json" };

export default function drawMap(
  id: string,
  earthquakes: earthquake[],
  width: number,
  height: number,
  animate: boolean,
  animationDuration: number,
  transitionDuration: number,
) {
  const svg = select(`#${id}`);
  svg.selectAll("*").remove();

  const sphere = {
    type: "Sphere",
  };
  const projection = geoEqualEarth()
    .fitSize([width, height], sphere);

  const geoGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection);

  svg
    .append("path")
    .datum(sphere)
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "black");

  svg
    .append("path")
    .datum(geoGraticule())
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "none")
    .attr("stroke", "white")
    .attr("opacity", 0.3);

  svg.selectAll(".countries")
    .data(countries.features)
    .join("path")
    .attr("class", "countries")
    .attr("d", geoGenerator)
    .attr("fill", "grey");

  if (animate) {
    const amplExtent = extent(
      earthquakes,
      (d: earthquake) => d.ampl,
    );

    const rScale = scaleSqrt()
      .domain(amplExtent)
      .range([2, 20]);

    const colorScale = scaleLinear().domain(amplExtent)
      .range(["yellow", "red"]);

    const timeExtent = extent(
      earthquakes,
      (d: earthquake) => d.time,
    );
    const delayScale = scaleLinear().domain(timeExtent)
      .range([0, animationDuration]);

    svg.selectAll("circle")
      .data(earthquakes)
      .join("circle")
      .attr("cx", (d: earthquake) => projection([d.lon, d.lat])[0])
      .attr("cy", (d: earthquake) => projection([d.lon, d.lat])[1])
      .attr("fill", (d: earthquake) => colorScale(d.ampl))
      .attr("r", 0)
      .transition()
      .duration(transitionDuration)
      .delay((d: earthquake) => delayScale(d.time))
      .attr("r", (d: earthquake) => rScale(d.ampl));
  }
}
```

And just like that, we animated our earthquakes! But it would be even better if the earthquakes grew in size and then disappeared.

![Animated earthquakes on a map created with D3.](/assets/d3-map/first-play.gif)

Let‚Äôs add another transition so that after growing, the circles return to an `r` of `0`.

We can also update the paragraph we created earlier to show the current date. We‚Äôll use the globally available `setInterval` function, which runs a function at a specified interval. Here, every 100ms, we use the `.invert()` method of our `delayScale` to retrieve a corresponding time value. We then format this time using the `formatDate` function from the [journalism library](https://jsr.io/@nshiab/journalism), which I maintain. Finally, we insert the formatted date into the paragraph.

To stop the `setInterval` from running indefinitely, we store its `intervalId`. Once the animation has been running longer than the total duration, we stop it using `clearInterval(intervalId)`. We also return the `intervalId` so it can be used in our `<Map />` component. More on that in a moment.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/helpers/drawMap.ts" {86-88, 90-108}
import type { earthquake } from "$lib";
import {
  extent,

  const sphere = {
    type: "Sphere",

  const projection = geoEqualEarth()
    .fitSize([width, height], sphere);

  const geoGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection);

  svg
    .append("path")

  if (animate) {
    const amplExtent = extent(
      earthquakes,
      (d: earthquake) => d.ampl,
    );

    const rScale = scaleSqrt()
      .domain(amplExtent)
      .range([2, 20]);

    const colorScale = scaleLinear().domain(amplExtent)
      .range(["yellow", "red"]);

    const timeExtent = extent(
      earthquakes,
      (d: earthquake) => d.time,
    );
    const delayScale = scaleLinear().domain(timeExtent)
      .range([0, animationDuration]);

    svg.selectAll("circle")
      .data(earthquakes)
      .join("circle")
      .attr("cx", (d: earthquake) => projection([d.lon, d.lat])[0])
      .attr("cy", (d: earthquake) => projection([d.lon, d.lat])[1])
      .attr("fill", (d: earthquake) => colorScale(d.ampl))
      .attr("r", 0)
      .transition()
      .duration(transitionDuration)
      .delay((d: earthquake) => delayScale(d.time))
      .attr("r", (d: earthquake) => rScale(d.ampl))
      .transition()
      .duration(transitionDuration)
      .attr("r", 0);

    const dateParagraph = document.querySelector(`#${id}-date`);
    if (dateParagraph) {
      const interval = 100;
      let duration = 0;
      const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        if (duration > animationDuration) {
          clearInterval(intervalId);
        } else {
          const date = new Date(delayScale.invert(duration));
          dateParagraph.innerHTML = formatDate(
            date,
            "YYYY-MM-DD",
            { utc: true },
          );
          duration += interval;
        }
      }, interval);
      return intervalId;
    }
  }
}
```

We‚Äôre getting there! But we still need to take care of the button and the date paragraph once the animation is done.

![Animated earthquakes appearing and disappearing on a map created with D3.](/assets/d3-map/animating-circles.gif)

We can tweak our `$effect` in the `<Map />` component to fix the last few issues.

First, we retrieve the `intervalId` from `drawMap`. We also create a `setTimeout`, which triggers a function after a specified amount of time. In this case, if `animationDuration + transitionDuration` has elapsed, it means the last circle has finished animating. We can then switch the `animate` state back to `false`, which updates the button text. We also clear the date paragraph.

But be careful: when working with events or timers, it‚Äôs important to remember that you need to **clean them up manually**. For example, what happens if a user clicks the button multiple times? As it stands, it would create multiple `setInterval` calls, and the date paragraph would be updated chaotically!

That‚Äôs why at the end of the `$effect`, we add a cleanup function. This function is called **before** the effect runs again ‚Äî perfect for canceling the previous `setInterval` and `setTimeout` before starting new ones.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/components/Map.svelte" {20, 30-36, 38-41}
<script lang="ts">
    import earthquakesRaw from "../data/earthquakes.json";
    import drawMap from "../helpers/drawMap";

    const { id }: { id: string } = $props();

    const earthquakes = earthquakesRaw.map((d) => ({
        ...d,
        time: new Date(d.time),
    }));

    let width = $state(0);
    let height = $state(0);

    let animate = $state(false);
    const animationDuration = 10000;
    const transitionDuration = 500;

    $effect(() => {
        const intervalId = drawMap(
            id,
            earthquakes,
            width,
            height,
            animate,
            animationDuration,
            transitionDuration,
        );

        const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
            animate = false;
            const dateParagraph = document.querySelector(`#${id}-date`);
            if (dateParagraph) {
                dateParagraph.textContent = "";
            }
        }, animationDuration + transitionDuration);

        return () => {
            clearInterval(intervalId);
            clearTimeout(timeoutId);
        };
    });
</script>

<button
    onclick={() => {
        animate = !animate;
    }}>{animate ? "Stop ‚èπ" : "Play ‚èµ"}</button
>
<p id={`${id}-date`}></p>
<div>
    <svg {id} bind:clientWidth={width} bind:clientHeight={height}></svg>
</div>

<style>
    div {
        width: 100%;
    }
    svg {
        aspect-ratio: 16/9;
    }
    p {
        display: inline;
    }
</style>
```

And it woooooorks! A beautiful animated map of earthquakes made with D3.js and Svelte!
