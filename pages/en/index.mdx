# Code Like a Journalist

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nael Shiab. I am a [computational journalist](https://www.naelshiab.com/) based in Montreal. I work for CBC News as a Senior Data Producer.

This website is a free, open-source online data analysis and visualization course using JavaScript/TypeScript. It's available in English and French.

Thanks to the support of the [Michener Awards Foundation](https://www.michenerawards.ca/media-release/michener-awards-foundation-announces-its-2024-fellowships-winners/), I took several months off from my current job to fully focus on building the course. I can also count on the support of [Jean-Hugues Roy](https://github.com/jhroy), data journalist at La Presse and former journalism professor at UQAM.

The lessons are tailored for journalists, but I think anyone interested in answering questions of public interest with data, code, and algorithms will find it helpful.

To allow teachers and professors to reuse the course with their students, the content is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1).
