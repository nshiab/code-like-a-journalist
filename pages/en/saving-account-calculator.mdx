# Savings account calculator ðŸ’¸

Welcome to your first coding project! Note that I expect you to have completed the lessons in the *First steps* section. If you havenâ€™t, [start here](/first-steps/setup).

In this project, we will code a savings account calculator. It will help you practice the basics we've covered in previous lessons and reinforce these concepts with a concrete example.

Here's what you'll see in your terminal when completing this project. Your calculator will randomize the annual interest rates, so sometimes you'll win ðŸ“ˆ, and sometimes you'll lose! ðŸ“‰

## What's the question?

In journalism (and many other fields), it's important to clearly identify the question we want to answer from the start.

Hereâ€™s the question we want to answer today:
- How much could I make by putting my money in a savings account?

In my projects, I like to identify an indicator early on that will provide the answer to the question. Here, the indicator would be the **difference** between the **initial amount** and the **final balance** in the account.

Usually, there are also some variables or parameters that can be identified when starting a project. Here are a few factors that can impact the results:
- The **initial amount** of money.
- The **interest rate** of the account.
- The **fluctuation** of the interest rate.
- The **number of years** the money will stay in the account.

Also, to simplify our lives, let's decide to work with annual rates, so we will update the account balance just once a year.

With this in mind, we can start coding our calculator!

## Setup

Make a new folder somewhere on your computer, open it with VS Code, and create two files:

- `main.ts`, where we will write our code. To start, you can add `console.log("Hello!");` to it.
- `deno.json`, which lets VS Code know this is a Deno project and enables the Deno extension. You can tweak settings in this file, but we'll keep it empty for now.

Open the terminal and run the following command:  
`deno run --watch --check main.ts`

This command clears the terminal and reruns `main.ts` every time you save it (`CMD` + `S` on Mac or `CTRL` + `S` on PC).

## Number of years

If the money stays in the savings account for 10 years, it means we need to update the balance 10 times, once every year.

This sounds like a perfect job for a **loop**!

Let's start by iterating over the years. We could create a variable `years` so it will be easy to update the number of years we want and rerun the script.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
const years = 10;

for (let year = 0; year < years; year++) {
  console.log({ year });
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    You might be wondering what `{ year }` is in the code above. It's a shorter way of writing `{ year: year }`. It tells your computer to create an object with a key `year` associated with the value in the variable `year`. Short and sweet, isn't it?
</Callout>

![A screenshot showing VS Code running a TypeScript file with a loop.](/assets/saving-account-calculator/loop.png)

Instead of having numbers from `0` to `9`, it would be better to have actual years.

Let's add a variable `startingYear` and update our code.

Here's what's happening with our loop on line 4 now:
- `let year = startingYear` means that our loop will start with the `year` 2025.
- `year < startingYear + years` means that our loop will run while `year` is smaller than `2025 + 10`.
- `year++` means that `year` will increment by 1 on each iteration.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {1, 4}
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  console.log({ year });
}
```

![A screenshot showing VS Code running a TypeScript file with a loop to log years.](/assets/saving-account-calculator/starting-year.png)

While we're at it, we could store each object for each year in an array named `results` and log everything as a table.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {4, 7, 10}
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

const results = [];

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  results.push({ year });
}

console.table(results);
```

![A screenshot showing VS Code logging a table in the terminal.](/assets/saving-account-calculator/table.png)

## Interest rate and balance

Now, let's talk money!

We could create three new variables:
- `initialAmount` to store the money we put in the savings account at the beginning. I've put $5,000 in it.
- `interestRate` to store the annual interest rate. I've set it at 2%.
- `balance`, which represents the balance of the savings account. This should be created with `let` because we will update it every year in our loop. Initially, `balance` equals `initialAmount`.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {1, 2, 6}
const initialAmount = 5000;
const interestRate = 2;
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

let balance = initialAmount;

const results = [];

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  results.push({ year });
}

console.table(results);
```

In our loop, we can now create the variable `gainsOrLosses` to store the gains or losses for each year and then update `balance` accordingly.

We can also add `gainsOrLosses` and `balance` to our `results`.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {11-17}
const initialAmount = 5000;
const interestRate = 2;
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

let balance = initialAmount;

const results = [];

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  const gainsOrLosses = balance * (interestRate / 100);

  // This is a shorter way of writing:
  // balance = balance + gainsOrLosses
  balance += gainsOrLosses;

  results.push({ year, gainsOrLosses, balance });
}

console.table(results);
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    Note that `gainsOrLosses` is created **inside** the loop curly brackets. It's **scoped** inside the code block delimited by the `{}`, which means it only exists within it. If you try to log it on line 19, you'll get an error. **Scoping** is an important feature that helps avoid variable conflicts, but it also allows the computer to free up memory when something is no longer needed.
</Callout>

![A screenshot showing VS Code with a basic savings account calculator.](/assets/saving-account-calculator/basics.png)

It works! You already have a basic savings account calculator! Do you see the compounding interest making your money grow? ðŸ’µ

Now, let's improve it.

## Rounding values

By default, our computers don't round values. We need to tell them to do it.

To do so, we can rely on the `Math` built-in global object. It's always available when you code and contains many convenient methods and constants. In our case, we will use `Math.round()`, which rounds a `number` to the nearest integer.

Here, we just need to round `gainsOrLosses`.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {11}
const initialAmount = 5000;
const interestRate = 2;
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

let balance = initialAmount;

const results = [];

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  const gainsOrLosses = Math.round(balance * (interestRate / 100));

  balance += gainsOrLosses;

  results.push({ year, gainsOrLosses, balance });
}

console.table(results);
```

![A screenshot showing VS Code logging rounded values of a savings account calculator.](/assets/saving-account-calculator/round.png)

## Randomizing interest rates

This is working quite well, but in real life, interest rates fluctuate over time.

Of course, we can't predict the future, but we can randomize the interest rate to make things a little more interesting.

For that, we can use `Math.random()`, which returns a number between `0` and `1`.

Let's see it in action by calling it in our loop. We can comment out `console.table(results)` for now.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {11, 20}
const initialAmount = 5000;
const interestRate = 2;
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

let balance = initialAmount;

const results = [];

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  console.log(Math.random());

  const gainsOrLosses = Math.round(balance * (interestRate / 100));

  balance += gainsOrLosses;

  results.push({ year, gainsOrLosses, balance });
}

// console.table(results);
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    There are many random algorithms in the wild. `Math.random()` returns an approximately uniform distribution, which means you have roughly the same chance of getting any number between 0 and 1. Also, don't use it for anything related to security. It's not cryptographically secure.
</Callout>

![A screenshot showing VS Code logging random values.](/assets/saving-account-calculator/random.png)

Unless we are extraordinarily lucky, you won't have the same numbers as me being logged. The only certainty is that we both have numbers between `0` and `1`.

To randomize our interest rate (which is `2` right now), weâ€™d like to have something **less** or **more** than 2, randomly. This fluctuation could be **positive** or **negative**.

To get a random number thatâ€™s either positive or negative, we could simply subtract `0.5` from our random numbers.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {11}
const initialAmount = 5000;
const interestRate = 2;
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

let balance = initialAmount;

const results = [];

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  console.log(Math.random() - 0.5);

  const gainsOrLosses = Math.round(balance * (interestRate / 100));

  balance += gainsOrLosses;

  results.push({ year, gainsOrLosses, balance });
}

// console.table(results);
```

![A screenshot showing VS Code logging random values between -0.5 and 0.5.](/assets/saving-account-calculator/random-shift.png)

Now that we have random numbers between `-0.5` and `0.5`, we need to decide on the range of these fluctuations.

We can create a new variable `interestRateRange`. I've set it to `20`.

If we multiply our random numbers by this range, we now have random values between `-10` and `10`. That looks like a great interest rate fluctuation!

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {3, 12-14}
const initialAmount = 5000;
const interestRate = 2;
const interestRateRange = 20;
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

let balance = initialAmount;

const results = [];

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  const randomNumber = Math.random() - 0.5;
  const randomFluctuation = randomNumber * interestRateRange;
  console.log(randomFluctuation);

  const gainsOrLosses = Math.round(balance * (interestRate / 100));

  balance += gainsOrLosses;

  results.push({ year, gainsOrLosses, balance });
}

// console.table(results);
```

![A screenshot showing VS Code logging random values between -10 and 10.](/assets/saving-account-calculator/random-fluctuation.png)

We can now add this fluctuation to our `interestRate`. Since `interestRate` is set at 2% in my code, this gives me an interest rate of **2% Â± 10%** for a given year. This means the interest rate will randomly fall between **-8%** (a very bad year) and **12%** (an amazing performance)!

Let's update our code and bring back our table. For the sake of simplicity, we can also round our `randomInterestRate`. Now, every time you save (`CMD` + `S` on Mac or `CTRL` + `S` on PC), you'll see different results!

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {14, 16, 22, 28}
const initialAmount = 5000;
const interestRate = 2;
const interestRateRange = 20;
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

let balance = initialAmount;

const results = [];

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  const randomNumber = Math.random() - 0.5;
  const randomFluctuation = randomNumber * interestRateRange;
  const randomInterestRate = Math.round(interestRate + randomFluctuation);

  const gainsOrLosses = Math.round(balance * (randomInterestRate / 100));

  balance += gainsOrLosses;

  results.push({
    year,
    interestRate: randomInterestRate,
    gainsOrLosses,
    balance,
  });
}

console.table(results);
```

![A screenshot showing VS Code logging random results.](/assets/saving-account-calculator/random-results.png)

## Answering the question

We now have everything we need to answer our question.

First, let's retrieve the last object in our `results` array. This object stores the final balance.

Using it, we can calculate the final losses or gains and log the appropriate answer.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {28-40}
const initialAmount = 5000;
const interestRate = 2;
const interestRateRange = 20;
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

let balance = initialAmount;

const results = [];

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  const randomNumber = Math.random() - 0.5;
  const randomFluctuation = randomNumber * interestRateRange;
  const randomInterestRate = Math.round(interestRate + randomFluctuation);

  const gainsOrLosses = Math.round(balance * (randomInterestRate / 100));

  balance += gainsOrLosses;

  results.push({
    year,
    interestRate: randomInterestRate,
    gainsOrLosses,
    balance,
  });
}

// Because the indexes start at 0,
// the index of the last element
// is the number of elements minus 1.
const lastResult = results[results.length - 1];
const finalGainsOrLosses = lastResult.balance - initialAmount;

if (finalGainsOrLosses > 0) {
  console.log("\nCongratulations! You've made money!\n");
} else if (finalGainsOrLosses < 0) {
  console.log("\nSorry! You've lost money!\n");
} else {
  console.log("\nYou've neither lost nor gained money!\n");
}

console.table(results);
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    The `\n` at the beginning and end of the strings on lines 35, 37, and 39 is a special character that indicates a line break. It's often used in the terminal to add empty lines and make the output more readable.
</Callout>

It would be great to add more details, like the gains or losses made, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {30-32, 35-40, 42-47}
const initialAmount = 5000;
const interestRate = 2;
const interestRateRange = 20;
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

let balance = initialAmount;

const results = [];

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  const randomNumber = Math.random() - 0.5;
  const randomFluctuation = randomNumber * interestRateRange;
  const randomInterestRate = Math.round(interestRate + randomFluctuation);

  const gainsOrLosses = Math.round(balance * (randomInterestRate / 100));

  balance += gainsOrLosses;

  results.push({
    year,
    interestRate: randomInterestRate,
    gainsOrLosses,
    balance,
  });
}

const lastResult = results[results.length - 1];
const finalGainsOrLosses = lastResult.balance - initialAmount;
const perc = Math.round(
  (finalGainsOrLosses / initialAmount) * 100,
);

if (finalGainsOrLosses > 0) {
  console.log(`
Congratulations! You've made money!
Initial amount: $${initialAmount}
Final amount: $${lastResult.balance}
Gains: $${finalGainsOrLosses} (+${perc}%)
`);
} else if (finalGainsOrLosses < 0) {
  console.log(`
Sorry! You've lost money!
Initial amount: $${initialAmount}
Final amount: $${lastResult.balance}
Losses: $${finalGainsOrLosses} (${perc}%)
`);
} else {
  console.log("\nYou've neither lost nor gained money!\n");
}

console.table(results);
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
   The lines added here (35-40, 42-47) are using **template literals**. When you write strings with backticks (`` ` ``), you can create multiline text. You can also insert variables or code within the string by using `${}`. For example, `` `Two multiplied by two gives ${2 * 2}` `` will create the string `"Two multiplied by two gives 4"`. Template literals are very useful for creating dynamic text that changes based on your data and analysis results.
