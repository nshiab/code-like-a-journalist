# Refactoring

Coding is like a journey. You know where you start and where you want to go (in theory üòÖ). But you don‚Äôt know which road to take. So you start exploring, try one way, then go back, take a shortcut, hit dead ends, and follow longer roads until... you finally arrive at your destination. And that‚Äôs totally okay.

It‚Äôs the same with your code. You‚Äôll write a lot, make mistakes, find workarounds, and eventually get your first results. Your code will be messy and long. And that‚Äôs fine.

This is why **refactoring** is an important step. It means restructuring your code to improve its readability, maintainability, and sometimes performance, while keeping the same output.

A key aspect of refactoring is breaking down long scripts into modular functions.

In this lesson, we will take the final code from the [Savings account calculator üí∏](/saving-account-calculator) and refactor it. If you haven‚Äôt done this project, do it first! I also expect that you have completed all of the lessons in the **First steps** üßë‚Äçüéì section.

## Setup

Make a new folder somewhere on your computer, open it with VS Code, and create two files:

- `main.ts`, where we will write our code.
- `deno.json`, which lets VS Code know this is a Deno project and enables the Deno extension. You can tweak settings in this file, but we‚Äôll keep it empty for now.

Open the terminal and run the following command: `deno run --watch --check main.ts`

This command clears the terminal and reruns `main.ts` every time you save it (`CMD` + `S` on Mac or `CTRL` + `S` on PC).

Now, copy, paste, and save this code in `main.ts`. The script below calculates the gains or losses of a savings account over 10 years.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
const initialAmount = 5000;
const interestRate = 2;
const interestRateRange = 20;
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;
 
let balance = initialAmount;
 
const results = [];
 
for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  const randomNumber = Math.random() - 0.5;
  const randomFluctuation = randomNumber * interestRateRange;
  const randomInterestRate = Math.round(interestRate + randomFluctuation);
 
  const gainsOrLosses = Math.round(balance * (randomInterestRate / 100));
 
  balance += gainsOrLosses;
 
  results.push({
    year,
    interestRate: randomInterestRate,
    gainsOrLosses,
    balance,
  });
}
 
const lastResult = results[results.length - 1];
const finalGainsOrLosses = lastResult.balance - initialAmount;
const perc = Math.round(
  (finalGainsOrLosses / initialAmount) * 100,
);
 
if (finalGainsOrLosses > 0) {
  console.log(`
Congratulations! You've made money!
Initial amount: $${initialAmount}
Final amount: $${lastResult.balance}
Gains: $${finalGainsOrLosses} (+${perc}%)
`);
} else if (finalGainsOrLosses < 0) {
  console.log(`
Sorry! You've lost money!
Initial amount: $${initialAmount}
Final amount: $${lastResult.balance}
Losses: $${finalGainsOrLosses} (${perc}%)
`);
} else {
  console.log("\nYou've neither lost nor gained money!\n");
}
 
console.table(results);
```

This is what you should see in your terminal, with different values.

## Helper functions

The script works well, but reading all of this at once can be a bit intimidating. It could be refactored into something easier to read and understand.

We can do that by moving parts of the code into helper functions. Start by creating a new folder named `helpers` in your repository.

It looks like lines 12-14 could easily be encapsulated in a function. These lines compute a random interest rate. Let's create a new file named `randomInterestRate.ts` in the `helpers` folder and move these lines into a function.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="randomInterestRate.ts"
export default function getRandomInterestRate(
  interestRate: number,
  interestRateRange: number,
) {
  const randomNumber = Math.random() - 0.5;
  const randomFluctuation = randomNumber * interestRateRange;
  const randomInterestRate = Math.round(interestRate + randomFluctuation);

  return randomInterestRate;
}
```

Lines 28-50 are also great candidates for refactoring. These lines log a message based on the gains or losses. Let's move them into a function named `logAnswer`.

I also removed the `console.table(results)` since we don‚Äôt really need it.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="logAnswer.ts"
export default function logAnswer(
  initialAmount: number,
  results: { balance: number }[],
) {
  const lastResult = results[results.length - 1];
  const finalGainsOrLosses = lastResult.balance - initialAmount;
  const perc = Math.round(
    (finalGainsOrLosses / initialAmount) * 100,
  );

  if (finalGainsOrLosses > 0) {
    console.log(`
Congratulations! You've made money!
Initial amount: $${initialAmount}
Final amount: $${lastResult.balance}
Gains: $${finalGainsOrLosses} (+${perc}%)
`);
  } else if (finalGainsOrLosses < 0) {
    console.log(`
Sorry! You've lost money!
Initial amount: $${initialAmount}
Final amount: $${lastResult.balance}
Losses: $${finalGainsOrLosses} (${perc}%)
`);
  } else {
    console.log("\nYou've neither lost nor gained money!\n");
  }
}
```

You might be confused by the `results` type in the code above.

`{ balance: number }` describes an object with a key `balance` and an associated `number` value. The `[]` at the end indicates that we expect `results` to be an array of such objects.

This type description is important. In our code, we rely on the `balance`. This type ensures it‚Äôs there. If you try to pass an array of objects without a `balance` as a `number`, you‚Äôll get a type error.

To find the proper type, I just hovered over `results` in `main.ts` and copied the inferred type. No need to write it yourself! I removed the `year`, `interestRate`, and `gainsOrLosses` keys, since we don‚Äôt use them in the function.

Now, we can update our `main.ts`. We import our new functions and use them. Our script is now simpler and easier to understand.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts" {1-2, 20, 32}
import getRandomInterestRate from "./helpers/getRandomInterestRate.ts";
import logAnswer from "./helpers/logAnswer.ts";

const initialAmount = 5000;
const interestRate = 2;
const interestRateRange = 20;
const startingYear = 2025;
const years = 10;

let balance = initialAmount;

const results = [];

for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
  const randomInterestRate = getRandomInterestRate(
    interestRate,
    interestRateRange,
  );

  const gainsOrLosses = Math.round(balance * (randomInterestRate / 100));

  balance += gainsOrLosses;

  results.push({
    year,
    interestRate: randomInterestRate,
    gainsOrLosses,
    balance,
  });
}

logAnswer(initialAmount, results);
```

We could even go one step further by wrapping everything in `main.ts` inside a function named `runSimulation`.

Let‚Äôs create another file named `runSimulation.ts` in the `helpers` folder and move all of this code into it.

Since we are now in the `helpers` folder, we need to update the import paths for `getRandomInterestRate.ts` and `logAnswer.ts`.

Additionally, the constant variables `initialAmount`, `interestRate`, `interestRateRange`, `startingYear`, and `years` will now become parameters for the `runSimulation` function.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="runSimulation.ts"
import getRandomInterestRate from "./getRandomInterestRate.ts";
import logAnswer from "./logAnswer.ts";

export default function runSimulation(
  initialAmount: number,
  interestRate: number,
  interestRateRange: number,
  startingYear: number,
  years: number,
) {
  let balance = initialAmount;

  const results = [];

  for (let year = startingYear; year < startingYear + years; year++) {
    const randomInterestRate = getRandomInterestRate(
      interestRate,
      interestRateRange,
    );

    const gainsOrLosses = Math.round(balance * (randomInterestRate / 100));

    balance += gainsOrLosses;

    results.push({
      year,
      interestRate: randomInterestRate,
      gainsOrLosses,
      balance,
    });
  }

  logAnswer(initialAmount, results);
}
```

Now, we can update `main.ts` and make it... incredibly simple.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
import runSimulation from "./helpers/runSimulation.ts";

runSimulation(5000, 2, 20, 2025, 10);
```

Our code is now very modular. While our original script could only run one simulation at a time, we can now easily run a thousand or more!

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
import runSimulation from "./helpers/runSimulation.ts";

for (let i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
  console.log(`Simulation ${i}`);
  runSimulation(5000, 2, 20, 2025, 10);
}
```

    You might think that creating multiple files makes it more difficult to navigate your code. But if you press `CMD` on Mac or `CTRL` on PC and click on a function in your code, VS Code will automatically take you to the function‚Äôs file by opening a new tab.

## Conclusion

You don‚Äôt always have the luxury of time to refactor your code. But if you plan on reusing, sharing, or maintaining your code for a long time, it‚Äôs a well-worth investment‚Äîespecially if you add tests (but tests will be another lesson).
