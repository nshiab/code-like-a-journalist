# Fetching data

The Web is ubiquitous and an extraordinary source of data. In this lesson, we'll explore how to fetch and download data.

<NoticeIntro />

## Setup

Let's set things up for this lesson.

Make a new folder somewhere on your computer, open it with VS Code, and create two files:

- `main.ts`, where we will write our code. To start, you can add `console.log("Hello!");` to it.
- `deno.json`, which lets VS Code know this is a Deno project and enables the Deno extension. You can tweak settings in this file, but we'll keep it empty for now.

Open the terminal and run the following command: `deno run --watch --check main.ts`

This command clears the terminal and reruns `main.ts` every time you save it (`CMD` + `S` on Mac or `CTRL` + `S` on PC).

You can use this setup to test the code provided in this lesson.

## Fetching a JSON file

Let's fetch this [temp.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/temp.json) file. It contains the daily temperatures in Montreal from 2000 to 2020. I uploaded it to GitHub specifically for this lesson.

If you open it, you'll notice it's an array of objects, with each object storing a date string and a temperature.

![A screenshot showing VS Code running and watching a TypeScript file.](/assets/pushing-further/fetch/json-file.png)

To fetch it, you can use the `fetch()` function. It's globally available, so you can call it directly in your code. It requires the relevant URL as a string.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
const response = await fetch(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/temp.json",
);

console.log(response);
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
    `fetch()` is an **asynchronous** function, so we need `await` in front of it to ensure our computer fetches the resources before executing the next lines. For more information, check the *About await* section in the [Writing and reading files](/pushing-further/files) lesson.
</Callout>

We have a security warning! Deno warns us that some code is trying to connect to the internet. ‚ö†Ô∏è

By default, Deno blocks any script from connecting to the web, which is a great feature. Imagine running code sent by someone that steals your information!

![A screenshot showing Deno warning about a network connection.](/assets/pushing-further/fetch/allow-net.png)

To allow your code to connect to the internet, you need to pass the `--allow-net` flag in the terminal command.

So instead of running your script with `deno run --watch --check main.ts` as instructed at the beginning of this lesson, you must use `deno run --watch --check --allow-net main.ts`.

However, since we‚Äôll also write data to our computer later, let‚Äôs use the `-A` flag instead, which allows our script to do anything it needs.

Click on your terminal and press `CTRL + C` to stop the script from running (this works on both Mac and PC). Then run: `deno run --watch --check -A main.ts`

Now it works!

Wow... There is a lot of stuff in this response, and that‚Äôs normal. Your computer and the server hosting the file exchange a lot of information to ensure the connection works properly.

In our case, we know it‚Äôs a JSON file, so we can call the `.json()` asynchronous method to parse the response data as JSON.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
const response = await fetch(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/temp.json",
);

const data = await response.json();

console.log(data);
```

![A screenshot showing a fetched JSON file logged in the terminal.](/assets/pushing-further/fetch/json-data.png)

Here we go! We‚Äôve fetched the data, and now we can work with it!

Instead of fetching it every time, we could write the data to a file for future use.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
const response = await fetch(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/temp.json",
);

const data = await response.json();

await Deno.writeTextFile("./temp.json", JSON.stringify(data));
```

Congrats! You now know how to fetch and save JSON files. That was easy, wasn‚Äôt it? üòÑ

## Fetching a text/CSV file

Instead of JSON, you might want to fetch and save a CSV file, which is plain text.

It‚Äôs pretty straightforward: instead of calling `.json()` to parse the response, use `.text()`.

I uploaded [temp.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/temp.csv) on GitHub for this lesson.

Here‚Äôs the updated code to fetch and write it. We‚Äôll explore how to crunch CSV file data in another lesson.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
const response = await fetch(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/temp.csv",
);

const data = await response.text();

await Deno.writeTextFile("./temp.csv", data);
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
    To write the JSON data, we had to use `JSON.stringify()` because `writeTextFile` can only write strings, and the JSON data was an array of objects. However, the CSV data is already text, so we can pass it directly to `writeTextFile`.
</Callout>

## Fetching a webpage HTML

You can also fetch the source code of a webpage. For example, here‚Äôs how to retrieve the HTML from the Code Like a Journalist homepage.

We‚Äôll explore how to extract data from webpages (a technique known as *web scraping*) in another lesson.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
const response = await fetch(
  "https://www.code-like-a-journalist.com/en",
);

const html = await response.text();

console.log(html);
```

## Conclusion

You now know how to fetch and save data with Deno.

But there‚Äôs something else that is extremely useful and published on the Web: TypeScript libraries. Go check out the next lesson to discover what they are! üëÄ
