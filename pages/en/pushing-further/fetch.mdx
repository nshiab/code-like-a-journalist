# Fetching data

The Web is ubiquous and an extraordinary source of data. In this lesson, we'll see how to fetch/download data.

# Setup

Let's set things up for this lesson.

Make a new folder somewhere on your computer, open it with VS Code, and create two files:

- `main.ts`, where we will write our code. To start, you can add `console.log("Hello!");` to it.
- `deno.json`, which lets VS Code know this is a Deno project and enables the Deno extension. You can tweak settings in this file, but we'll keep it empty for now.

Open the terminal and run the following command: `deno run --watch --check main.ts`

This command clears the terminal and reruns `main.ts` every time you save it (`CMD` + `S` on Mac or `CTRL` + `S` on PC).

You can use this setup to test the code provided in this lesson.

## Fetching a JSON file

Let's fetch the `employee.json` file located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis/refs/heads/main/test/data/files/employees.json).

It's a file that I keep on GitHub to test my TypeScript library [simple-data-analysis](https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis/), which I'll show you how to use in another lesson.

It's an array of objects, with each object storing information about an employee in a fictious company.
