# Conditions

You are constantly using conditional statements in your everyday life. Is the water boiling in the pot? If it is, put in the pasta. Otherwise, wait a few more minutes. 🧑‍🍳

It's the same in your code. Depending on the data, you can instruct your program or algorithm to act differently.

Let's set things up for this lesson.

Make a new folder somewhere on your computer, open it with VS Code, and create two files:

- `main.ts`, where we will write our code. To start, you can add `console.log("Hello!");` to it.
- `deno.json`, which lets VS Code know this is a Deno project and enables the Deno extension. You can tweak settings in this file, but we'll keep it empty for now.

Open the terminal and run the following command: `deno run --watch --check main.ts`

This command clears the terminal and reruns `main.ts` every time you save it (`CMD` + `S` on Mac or `CTRL` + `S` on PC).

You can use this setup to test the code provided in this lesson.

## Conditional statements

To write conditions, we use the conditional statements `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

The first condition should always be tested with `if`. The condition should be enclosed in `()`. If the condition is met, the computer will execute the code inside the following `{}`.

If we want to test more than one condition, we use `else if` with a condition in `()` followed by code to be executed inside `{}`. Testing multiple conditions isn't always necessary.

If we want to run some code when none of the conditions are met, we use `else`. Since `else` doesn't test any condition, we don't need `()`, but we must provide the code to be executed inside `{}`. Although finishing with an `else` isn't mandatory, it often helps prevent unexpected bugs.

For example, the code below compares `myAge` and `yourAge`:
- If `myAge` is greater than `yourAge` (line 6), we log `I am older than you!` in the terminal. The remaining conditional statements are skipped.
- If the first condition is not met, we check another condition with `else if` (line 8). If `myAge` is smaller than `yourAge`, we log `You are older than me!`. The remaining conditional statements are skipped.
- Finally, if none of the conditions above are met, it means that we are the same age. In this case, we use `else` (line 10) to log `We are the same age!`.


```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
// Change the ages
// to test the different outcomes.
const myAge = 36;
const yourAge = 25;

if (myAge > yourAge) {
  console.log("I am older than you!");
} else if (myAge < yourAge) {
  console.log("You are older than me!");
} else {
  console.log("We are the same age!");
}
```

## Comparison operators

When using `if` and `else if`, the condition inside the `()` should always result in a boolean value.

The previous example works because we used the comparison operators `>` and `<`, which return a boolean.

Here are the main comparison operators you'll use in your daily work:
- `>`: greater than
- `>=`: greater than or equal to
- `<`: less than
- `<=`: less than or equal to
- `===`: equal to
- `!==`: not equal to

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  You might see examples around the web with `==` and `!=`. These operators don't check for the type of values, so it's best to stick with `===` and `!==`, which check for strict equality.
</Callout>

And here are the operators in action.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
// Change the ages to test the different operators.
// Don't worry about the `: number` for now.
const myAge: number = 36;
const yourAge: number = 25;

const greater = myAge > yourAge;
console.log("greater =>", greater);

const greaterOrEqual = myAge >= yourAge;
console.log("greaterOrEqual =>", greaterOrEqual);

const younger = myAge < yourAge;
console.log("younger =>", younger);

const youngerOrEqual = myAge <= yourAge;
console.log("youngerOrEqual =>", youngerOrEqual);

const sameAge = myAge === yourAge;
console.log("sameAge =>", sameAge);

const differentAge = myAge !== yourAge;
console.log("differentAge =>", differentAge);
```

## Logical operators

Sometimes, you want to check multiple conditions in one statement. This is where logical operators `&&` and `||` are useful.

- `&&` means **AND**
- `||` means **OR**

For example, let's say we need an algorithm to check if you are old enough to have a drink in a bar in Quebec (at least 18) or Ontario (at least 19). In case you don't know, Quebec and Ontario are different Canadian provinces. 🥂🇨🇦

Without logical operators, it could look like this, with nested conditions. It works, but nested conditions can be difficult to read and debug.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
// Change the age and province to test the conditions.
// Don't worry about the `: number` and `: string` for now.
const myAge: number = 18;
const myProvince: string = "Quebec";

if (myProvince === "Quebec") {
  if (myAge >= 18) {
    console.log("You are allowed!");
  } else {
    console.log("You are not allowed!");
  }
} else if (myProvince === "Ontario") {
  if (myAge >= 19) {
    console.log("You are allowed!");
  } else {
    console.log("You are not allowed!");
  }
} else {
  console.log("I don't know this province!");
}
```

Here's the same code with the logical operator `&&` to make sure `age` **AND** `province` are specific values. Simpler to understand and easier to debug!

Here's what the code below does:
- On line 6, we test if `myProvince` is `"Quebec"` **AND** `myAge` is greater or equal to `18`. If it's the case, you can order a drink.
- On line 8, we test if `myProvince` is `"Ontario"` **AND** `myAge` is greater or equal to `19`. If it's the case, you can order a drink.
- At this point, it's possible the province is something unexpected. On line 10, we test if `myProvince` is not `"Quebec"` **AND** not `"Ontario"`. If it's the case, we let the user know we don't know this province.
- On line 12, the only remaining possibility is that the user is not allowed to order a drink.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
// Change the age and province to test the conditions.
// Don't worry about the `: number` and `: string` for now.
const myAge: number = 18;
const myProvince: string = "Quebec";

if (myProvince === "Quebec" && myAge >= 18) {
  console.log("You are allowed!");
} else if (myProvince === "Ontario" && myAge >= 19) {
  console.log("You are allowed!");
} else if (myProvince !== "Quebec" && myProvince !== "Ontario") {
  console.log("I don't know this province!");
} else {
  console.log("You are not allowed!");
}
```

We could also write the same algorithm with a mix of `&&` and `||`. And we can also use variables to simplify the code while at it.

Here's what the code below does:
- On line 6, we test if `myProvince` is `"Quebec"` **AND** `myAge` is greater or equal to `18`. We store the result in the variable `isAllowedInQuebec`. (If you hover over it, you'll see its type is `boolean`).
- On line 7, we do the same thing but for Ontario.
- On line 9, we check if `isAllowedInQuebec` is `true` **OR** `isAllowedInOntario` is `true`. Only one needs to be `true` for the following code between `{}` to be executed.
- On line 11, we log a message to the user in case the province is something unexpected.
- When the computer reaches line 13, the only possibility is that the user is not allowed to order a drink!

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
// Change the age and province to test the conditions.
// Don't worry about the `: number` and `: string` for now.
const myAge: number = 18;
const myProvince: string = "Quebec";

const isAllowedInQuebec = myProvince === "Quebec" && myAge >= 18;
const isAllowedInOntario = myProvince === "Ontario" && myAge >= 19;

if (isAllowedInQuebec || isAllowedInOntario) {
  console.log("You are allowed!");
} else if (myProvince !== "Quebec" && myProvince !== "Ontario") {
  console.log("I don't know this province!");
} else {
  console.log("You are not allowed!");
}
```

## Conditional operator

There another way to do simple conditional statements with the `condition ? if true : if false` syntax. This syntax is called the **conditional operator** (also called the **ternary operator**).

It's great for simple conditions. It allows you to replace `if` and `else` statements in one line.

Here's another variation of our algorithm with this syntax. One other big difference here is that instead of using `console.log` everywhere, we create a variable `message` and use `console.log` with it just at the end.

Here's what the code does:
- On line 6, we create a variable `message` with an empty string. We use `let` so we can overwritte its value later.
- On line 8, we check if `myProvince` equals to `"Quebec"`.
- If the province is Quebec, line 9 gets executed:
  - If `myAge` is greater or equal to `18`, `message` is overwritten with `"You are allowed!"`.
  - Otherwise, `message` is overwritten with `"You are not allowed!"`
- On line 10, we check if `myProvince` equals to `"Ontario"`.
- If the province is Ontario, line 11 gets executed:
  - If `myAge` is greater or equal to `19`, `message` is overwritten with `"You are allowed!"`.
  - Otherwise, `message` is overwritten with `"You are not allowed!"`
- The only possibility left on line 12 is that the province is not Quebec or Ontario. So we overwritte the message on line 13 with `"I don't know this province!"`.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
// Change the age and province to test the conditions.
// Don't worry about the `: number` and `: string` for now.
const myAge: number = 18;
const myProvince: string = "Quebec";

let message = "";

if (myProvince === "Quebec") {
  message = myAge >= 18 ? "You are allowed!" : "You are not allowed!";
} else if (myProvince === "Ontario") {
  message = myAge >= 19 ? "You are allowed!" : "You are not allowed!";
} else {
  message = "I don't know this province!";
}

console.log(message);
```

## Conclusion

All of the algorithms checking if the user can order a drink will give the same results. So, which one is the best?

Well, it really depends on the context and your personnal preferences.

Remember that you are learning a programming language. And as in any languages, there are many ways to say the same thing. As long as your computer and colleagues will understand you, you'll be fine! 🤖
