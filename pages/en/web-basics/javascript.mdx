# How to use JavaScript to make a web page interactive

Before starting, make sure you have completed the previous sections, especially **1. First steps üßë‚Äçüéì**, **2. Pushing further üöÄ**, and the lesson on [HTML](/web-basics/html) and [CSS](/web-basics/css).

JavaScript has been created in 1995 by [Brendan Eich](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich). Since then, the language has evolded but kept powering the Web. It's just in 2012 that TypeScript apperead, adding more features to JavaScript, like types. We say that TypeScript is a **superset** of JavaScript.

Hovewer, browsers still run JavaScript. They don't understand TypeScript. This is why modern web development toolsets transpile TypeScript to JavaScript.

But in this lesson, we won't use any tooling. We will run JavaScript code (without types) that will be run directly by the browser.

## Setup

We don't have to install anything for this lesson, but we will work with the code of the previous lesson.

Open an empty folder with VS Code and create an `index.html` file. Copy and paste the code below in it.

```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Alma Mater</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
    <p id="first-paragraph">I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM).</p>
    <img src="university.jpg" alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."/>
    <p class="red-text">The picture above comes from Wikimedia. You can find it <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UQAM-Judith-Jasmin.jpg">here</a> along with its license.</p>
    <p class="red-text">Montreal is a wonderful city. You should visit it!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Also create a `style.css` file and copy and paste the code below.

```css showLineNumbers filename="style.css"
p {
    font-weight: bold;
}

#first-paragraph {
    color: blue;
}

.red-text {
    color: red;
}
```

## Creating a `.js` file

While you can write JavaScript directly into the HTML with the `<script>` and `</script>` tags, it's usually best to isolate your JavaScript into one `.js` file or more. It will make your code easier to maintain in the long run.

Let's create a new file `main.js` with a simple `console.log` in it.

```js showLineNumbers filename="main.js"
console.log("Hi!)
```
