# How to use JavaScript to make a web page interactive

Before starting, make sure you have completed the previous sections, especially **1. First steps üßë‚Äçüéì**, **2. Pushing further üöÄ**, and the lessons on [HTML](/web-basics/html) and [CSS](/web-basics/css).

JavaScript was created in 1995 by [Brendan Eich](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich). Since then, the language has evolved but has continued to power the web. It wasn't until 2012 that TypeScript appeared, adding features like types to JavaScript. TypeScript is called a **superset** of JavaScript.

However, browsers still run JavaScript. They don't understand TypeScript. This is why modern web development toolsets transpile TypeScript into JavaScript.

In this lesson, we won‚Äôt use any tooling. We'll run JavaScript code directly in the browser. Don‚Äôt worry: by now, you know TypeScript, so JavaScript will be a piece of cake. Tt‚Äôs the same, just without the types!

<NoticeIntro />

## Setup

We don‚Äôt need to install anything for this lesson, but we will work with the code from the previous lesson.

Open an empty folder in VS Code and create an `index.html` file. Copy and paste the code below into it.


```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Alma Mater</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
    <p id="first-paragraph">I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM).</p>
    <img src="university.jpg" alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."/>
    <p class="red-text">The picture above comes from Wikimedia. You can find it <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UQAM-Judith-Jasmin.jpg">here</a> along with its license.</p>
    <p class="red-text">Montreal is a wonderful city. You should visit it!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Also, create a `style.css` file and copy and paste the code below.

```css showLineNumbers filename="style.css"
p {
    font-weight: bold;
}

#first-paragraph {
    color: blue;
}

.red-text {
    color: red;
}
```

## Creating a `.js` file

While you can write JavaScript directly into the HTML with the `<script>` and `</script>` tags, it's usually best to isolate your JavaScript into one `.js` file or more. This will make your code easier to maintain in the long run.

Let's create a new file `main.js` with a simple `console.log` in it.

```js showLineNumbers filename="main.js"
console.log("Hi!");
```

To run this code in your webpage, you need to import it into your HTML. Below, we are specifying the `defer` attribute so our JavaScript code will be executed once the entire page is ready. This is important if you want to modify the content of the page, as we do. If your script runs too soon and the elements have not yet been created by the browser, you'll get an error.

However, sometimes you don't need the page elements. If you want your script to run as soon as possible, you can specify the `async` attribute instead of `defer`.

```html showLineNumbers filename="index.html" {8}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>My Alma Mater</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        <script src="main.js" defer></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My Alma Mater: UQAM</h1>
        <p id="first-paragraph">
            I earned my bachelor's degree in journalism at Universit√© du Qu√©bec
            √† Montr√©al (UQAM).
        </p>
        <img
            src="university.jpg"
            alt="UQAM campus with Montreal‚Äôs downtown skyline in the background."
        />
        <p class="red-text">
            The picture above comes from Wikimedia. You can find it <a
                href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UQAM-Judith-Jasmin.jpg"
            >here</a> along with its license.
        </p>
        <p class="red-text">
            Montreal is a wonderful city. You should visit it!
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```

To check if our code runs on our page, we can refresh the page and check the console.

When we ran TypeScript with Deno, `console.log` displayed information in the terminal. But now that we are working on a web page, this information is displayed in the browser's console.

You should see `Hi!` in the console, indicating that our code runs every time the page is loaded!

## Event listeners

When you want the user to interact with your page, you first need to select the element to be interacted with and then add one or more event listeners. To select elements, you can use selectors just like you would in CSS.

In the example below, we changed the `main.js` file to select the paragraph with the `id` `first-paragraph`. Then, we added two event listeners:
- A `mouseover` event to underline the text when the user moves their mouse over it.
- A `mouseout` event to remove the underline when the user moves their mouse away.

When the page loads, our code looks for the first paragraph and then waits for the user to interact with it. If the interaction is of the right type, it triggers the function passed to the relevant event listener. Easy!

```js showLineNumbers filename="main.js"
const firstParagraph = document.querySelector("#first-paragraph");

firstParagraph.addEventListener("mouseover", () => {
    firstParagraph.style.textDecoration = "underline";
});

firstParagraph.addEventListener("mouseout", () => {
    firstParagraph.style.textDecoration = "none";
});
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
When reading other online tutorials, you might hear about the DOM (Document Object Model). It's the JavaScript representation of the HTML. When you select an HTML element in JavaScript, you select it from the DOM.
</Callout>

There are [many different types of listeners](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp), and you can also remove them with the `removeEventListener` method. However, make sure to use a named function instead of an arrow function like above; otherwise, it won't work.

## Conclusion

Here, I am just showing you a basic example where we change the style of a paragraph. But you can do anything you want to the page with JavaScript, like creating or removing elements and changing their content based on user interactions.

You could also use `fetch` to retrieve different data files and create various charts based on user choices. Or you could `fetch` fresh data every 15 seconds with [`setInterval`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp) and redraw charts, like we do for election dashboards. By the way, `fetch` in Deno works the same way as `fetch` in the browser. üòä

There are also more specialized APIs, like the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API), to monitor how far the user scrolls and trigger animations, like we do in *scrolly-telling* projects such as [this one](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2022/07/ilots-chaleur-villes-inegalites-injustice-changements-climatiques/en/). (I know the word "API" can be confusing here since we‚Äôve used APIs mainly for retrieving data so far, but an API can be anything, not just for data. This one is more like a function.)

I kept this lesson very simple since it's your first time coding JavaScript for the web, and we are quite limited because we haven't run a local server. But I think you are now ready for the next step!
