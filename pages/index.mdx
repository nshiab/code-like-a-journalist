# Code Like a Journalist

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nael Shiab. I am a [computational journalist](https://www.naelshiab.com/) based in Montreal. I work for CBC News as a Senior Data Producer.

This website will be a free, open-source online data analysis and visualization course using JavaScript/TypeScript. It will be available in English and French.

I'll work on it with the help of [Jean-Hugues Roy](https://github.com/jhroy), journalism professor at UQAM. Thanks to the support of the [Michener Awards Foundation](https://www.michenerawards.ca/media-release/michener-awards-foundation-announces-its-2024-fellowships-winners/), I plan to take several months off from my current job to fully focus on building the course.

The lessons will be tailored for journalists, but I hope anyone interested in answering questions of public interest with data and code will find it helpful.
