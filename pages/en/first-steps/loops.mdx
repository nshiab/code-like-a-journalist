# Loops

We often use computers to perform repetitive tasks quickly and efficiently. And this is what *loops* are for: to *iterate*!

Let's set things up for this lesson.

Make a new folder somewhere on your computer, open it with VS Code, and create two files:

- `main.ts`, where we will write our code. To start, you can add `console.log("Hello!");` to it.
- `deno.json`, which lets VS Code know this is a Deno project and enables the Deno extension. You can tweak settings in this file, but we'll keep it empty for now.

Open the terminal and run the following command: `deno run --watch --check main.ts`

This command clears the terminal and reruns `main.ts` every time you save it (`CMD` + `S` on Mac or `CTRL` + `S` on PC).

You can use this setup to test the code provided in this lesson.

## With arrays

Let's say we have ten numbers (1 to 10), and we want to multiply each of them by 2 and log the results.

We could write this code:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
console.log(1, "=>", 1 * 2);
console.log(2, "=>", 2 * 2);
console.log(3, "=>", 3 * 2);
console.log(4, "=>", 4 * 2);
console.log(5, "=>", 5 * 2);
console.log(6, "=>", 6 * 2);
console.log(7, "=>", 7 * 2);
console.log(8, "=>", 8 * 2);
console.log(9, "=>", 9 * 2);
console.log(10, "=>", 10 * 2);
```

But it's pretty repetitive. And what happens if we want to do the same thing but with 100 numbers? Or if we want to multiply by 3 instead of 2? Typing or modifying it all would take a long time!

Instead, you can use... loops and arrays! Arrays are *iterable*, which means you can use them easily with loops.

To create a loop, you start with `for`, followed by the loop parameters between `()`. Then you need to tell the computer what must be done at each iteration inside `{}`.

Let's rewrite our code, but this time with an array and a `for` loop.

Here's what's happening in the code below, step by step:
- On line 2, we create an array `numbers`.
- On line 4, we create a new variable `n` that will store the values from `numbers`, one by one.
- On lines 5 and 6, we instruct the computer to multiply the `n` value by two, store it in a new variable, and log it. The computer will do this for each value in `numbers`, one by one.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
// Add or remove items in the array and save.
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

for (const n of numbers) {
  const multiple = n * 2;
  console.log(n, "=>", multiple);
}
```

If the computer could talk ðŸ¤–, here's what it would say when running this script: 
- Line 1: This is just a comment for humans. I ignore it.
- Line 2: Hello `numbers`! Nice to meet you.
- Line 3: Nothing. Humans love empty spaces.
- Line 4: Hey, this is a `for` loop. Hello `n`! I'll use you to store each value of `numbers`, one by one.
- Line 5-6: Let's iterate!
  - I put the first value of `numbers` in `n`. I multiply `n` by 2 and I log it.
  - I put the second value of `numbers` in `n`. I multiply `n` by 2 and I log it.
  - [...]
  - I put the tenth value of `numbers` in `n`. I multiply `n` by 2 and I log it.
- Line 7: I iterated over all values of `numbers`. I am done! Sayonara! ðŸ‘‹

The beauty of this syntax is that no matter the number of values in `numbers` (10, 1,000, or 1,000,000), the code will remain short and straightforward, and you can be confident that all values will be processed.

Also, the actual code for the iterations is contained between the `{}`. So, if you need to multiply by 3 instead of 2, you only need to update your code in one place, reducing the risk of missing another spot and introducing bugs.

## Regular `for` loop

While it's convenient to loop over an array, you don't need one to iterate.

If you want to say hello a million times, you can use a regular `for` loop, as shown in the code below.

The loop requires three expressions between `()` before running the code inside the following `{}`:
- First, you need a variable to store a number. By convention, itâ€™s called `i`, but you can name it anything you want. This variable represents the starting number for the iteration. Here, itâ€™s `let i = 0`.
- Second, you need a condition to keep the loop running and eventually stop it. This is usually done using comparison operators like `<` or `<=` with the variable. Here, itâ€™s `i < 1_000_000`, meaning the iterations continue while `i` is smaller than `1_000_000`.
- Lastly, you need to specify how to increment the variable. Here, we use `i++`, which means increment by 1 on each iteration.

These expressions must be separated by `;` within the `()`.

The result is a loop starting with `i = 0` and stopping when `i` equals 999,999. Because `i` increments by 1 on each iteration, this loop iterates 1,000,000 times.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
for (let i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {
  console.log(i, "Hello!");
}
```

You just asked your computer to do something A MILLION TIMES! And with just 3 lines of code! Do you feel the POWER in your hands? ðŸ˜ˆ

You can play with the expressions. For example, try making these changes and see what happens:
- Replace `let i = 0` with `let i = 1000`
- Replace `i < 1_000_000` with `i <= 1_100`
- Replace `i++` with `i += 10`

## `break`

Sometimes, you might want to stop your loop when a specific condition is met. To do this, you can use the `break` statement. It works in any loop.

For example, in the code below, we loop over `names`, but we break the loop if one of the names starts with J. Since `"Jerry"` meets this condition, it's the last name being logged.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
const names = [
  "Tom",
  "Ivan",
  "Jerry",
  "John",
  "Smith",
  "Derek",
  "Stuart",
  "Dustin",
  "Jenny",
  "Jasmine",
];

for (const n of names) {
  console.log(n);
  if (n.startsWith("J")) {
    break;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Loops are an incredible tool for data analysis. They allow you to iterate quickly and efficiently through massive volumes of data with just a few lines of code.

Note that there are other kinds of loops, like `while` loops. However, they are rarely used in a data analysis context.

And now, I think it's time for our first project! We've covered all the basics. Congrats! ðŸ•º
