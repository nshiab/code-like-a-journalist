# Running tasks

<YouTube videoId="_rcZFEqu1nM"/>

Tasks are a way to avoid rewriting long commands in the terminal. They are very convenient and widely used.

<NoticeIntro />

Make a new folder somewhere on your computer, open it with VS Code, and create two files:

- `main.ts`, where we will write our code.
- `deno.json`, which lets VS Code know this is a Deno project and enables the Deno extension. You can tweak settings in this file, but we'll keep it empty for now.

Copy and paste the following code into `main.ts`. This script comes from the [Fetching data](/pushing-further/fetch) lesson. It fetches a JSON file from GitHub, parses it, and logs it.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="main.ts"
const response = await fetch(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nshiab/data-fetch-lesson/refs/heads/main/temp.json",
);
 
const data = await response.json();
 
console.log(data);
```

Now, to run and watch this file, we previously used `deno run --watch --check -A main.ts`, but it's a bit annoying to write, and remembering all these options is tiring. The more complex your projects get, the longer these terminal commands can become.

So, let's create a `main` task instead.

Open your `deno.json` and add this. Don't forget to save! ðŸ™ƒ

```json showLineNumbers filename="deno.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "main": "deno run --watch --check -A main.ts"
  }
}
```

Now, you can run `deno task main`. Deno will look inside your `deno.json` to find a task named `main` and execute the relevant command.

This is much easier to type! And if you want to add more options or update the task, youâ€™ll still be able to run it with `deno task main`.

    You can have as many tasks as you want, and you can name them however you like. In other popular runtimes, like **Node.js** or **Bun**, `tasks` are called `scripts` and are stored in `package.json` instead of `deno.json`. But Deno is compatible with them and will find them anyway.

That's it! Happy coding! ðŸ¥³
