# Understanding library versions

You may have noticed that library versions on NPM, JSR and in your `deno.json` (or `package.json`) have numbers attached to them.

For example, at the time of writing, the [Simple Data Analysis](https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis) library is at version 5.0.5. This is called **semantic versioning**, or **SemVer** for short.

When library maintainers update these numbers, there is (usually ðŸ˜…) a good reason why â€” and in this lesson, Iâ€™m going to explain what that reason is!

## Major, minor, and patch

### Major

The first number indicates major versions. When this number changes, it means that breaking changes were introduced. If you are using an older version and update the library, your code will probably need to be updated too. Some classes, methods, functions, and others may have been changed or even removed.

So if you plan on updating to a major version, always plan some extra time to adjust your project. And always ask yourself if it's actually worth it!

For example, if you are using `simple-data-analysis@5.0.0` and there is a new version `simple-data-analysis@6.0.0`, check the [release notes](https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis/releases) to weigh the pros and cons of updating your project with it.

Thereâ€™s also an extra thing to know about major versions: when itâ€™s a `v0.x.x` version, it usually means that the library is not ready for production. The maintainers will probably introduce a lot of breaking changes before it reaches `v1.0.0`, as theyâ€™re trying to figure out the best way to build everything. A lot of bugs are to be expected too.

### Minor

Minor versions are usually used to notify about new features.

For example, if you are using `simple-data-analysis@5.0.0` and thereâ€™s a new `simple-data-analysis@5.1.0`, it probably means that there is a new class, new methods, or new functions available. The old ones are still there and should still work as before.

It's much safer to update to a minor version, since you shouldn't have to recode parts of your project. But this is code, and maintainers are humans (for now ðŸ¤–), so there are always some surprises! ðŸ˜¬

### Patch

Patch versions are usually used to fix bugs and improve things under the hood. They usually don't bring anything new to the table â€” just make the library work better.

Patch versions are the safest versions to update to. You shouldn't have to recode anything in your project when updating to a patch version.

### Other versions

Some maintainers also like to publish `alpha`, `beta`, and `rc` (release candidate) versions.

These versions are available to anyone to use while the code changes â€” but at their own risk. A lot of bugs and breaking changes are to be expected.

## `^` and `~`

Because it could be annoying to update libraries all the time for `minor` and `patch` versions, some projects prefix the library versions in the `deno.json` or `package.json` with `^` or `~`.

These symbols define a **range** of acceptable versions for a library.

### `^` (Caret)

The `^` means that a project should stick to a major version, but can use any minor and patch version.

For example, `simple-data-analysis@^5.0.0` means that the project is allowed to use the latest version of `v5.x.x`. So `simple-data-analysis@5.1.0` and `simple-data-analysis@5.1.1` would be acceptable.

### `~` (Tilde)

The `~` is stricter, meaning that the project should stick to a major **and** minor version, but can use any patch version.

For example, `simple-data-analysis@~5.1.0` means that the project is allowed to use the latest version of `v5.1.x`, like `simple-data-analysis@5.1.1`.

## Updating dependencies

You can follow maintainers and projects on GitHub to stay up to date with your favorite libraries (check the [GitHub lesson](/git-and-github/github-basics)), but you can also use Deno and NPM directly to check if some of your libraries are outdated.

### Deno

With Deno, you can run `deno outdated` in your terminal. Deno will automatically check JSR and NPM and let you know whatâ€™s available. You can then update the libraries of your choice.

There are also [different options](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/outdated/) available with this command.

Always double-check that your project is running as expected after updating and that the correct versions are written down in your `deno.json`.

### NPM

NPM does the same thing with the `npm outdated` command. To update libraries, you can use `npm update`.

Again, always double-check that your project is running as expected after updating and that the correct versions are written down in your `package.json`.

## Conclusion

SemVer is important to understand the potential consequences of updating a library. But remember that it's a convention â€” nothing forces anyone to follow it.

In fact, some big open-source projects donâ€™t follow SemVer, like... TypeScript! The team instead follows a calendar-based release schedule and sticks to it. Last time I checked, they released a new minor version every three months and a new major version when the minor version exceeds `9`. But they do a lot of extra work to avoid breaking changes, so updating is often seamless for coders like us!
