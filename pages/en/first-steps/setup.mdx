# Setup

Let's install everything we need.

## A code editor

Code is just text. There is no magic to it. In theory, you could write your code in any text editor, but it's more convenient to use a code editor that comes with many useful features.

You have many free and interesting options, but the most popular is Visual Studio Code, and it's the one we will use. It's an open-source project maintained by Microsoft.

Download it from the [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it.

Once installed, open it. It should look like this:

## A JavaScript runtime

For your computer to understand JavaScript/TypeScript and run it, you need a JavaScript runtime.

Again, you have many great open-source options out there, but I find Deno particularly easy to use. Deno is maintained by Deno Land Inc., with Ryan Dahl as the CEO. Dahl also created Node.js, another open-source runtime that is very popular.

To install it, visit https://deno.com/ and copy the relevant command for your operating system.

Don't worry if you have a different version. As long as it's v2.x.x, you will be fine.
