Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nael Shiab. I am a [computational journalist](https://www.naelshiab.com/) based in Montreal. I work for [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news) as a Senior Data Producer.

This website is a free, open-source online course on data analysis and visualization using TypeScript. It's available in English and French. I assume the audience knows nothing about data or code, and I guide you step by step until you're ready to take off on your own.

In an era of financial struggles for newsrooms, I wanted to create a course that lowers the barrier to entry for students and journalists looking to specialize in data and code. Throughout the years, I have learned so much from free tutorials and open-source projects maintained by passionate colleagues. Making this course free and open is my way of giving back.

The lessons are tailored for journalists, but I believe anyone interested in answering questions of public interest with data, code, and algorithms will find them helpful.

Thanks to the support of the [Michener Awards Foundation](https://www.michenerawards.ca/media-release/michener-awards-foundation-announces-its-2024-fellowships-winners/), I took several months off from my current job to fully focus on building the course. I can also count on the support of [Jean-Hugues Roy](https://github.com/jhroy), data journalist at La Presse and former journalism professor at UQAM.
